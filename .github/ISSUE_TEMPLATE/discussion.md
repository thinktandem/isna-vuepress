## Prompt

> Example: A lack of standard and well-defined GitHub issues we can share across projects is causing unneeded confusion and overhead. Should we have some standard labels? What should they be?
>
> [Here are some good guideliness for writing out discussions](https://docs.thinktandem.io/guides/improve-tandem.html#_1-discussion)

## Ticket Checklist

Make sure you complete the following checklist

- [ ] I'm aware of [what a discussion actually entails](https://docs.thinktandem.io/guides/improve-tandem.html#suggesting-a-change)
- [ ] I've assigned this task to myself and one of the Keepers of the Faith
- [ ] I've **not** set a story point estimation
- [ ] I've selected _at most_ two labels that _best_ describe what part of the business this ticket improves eg `sales`, `dev`, etc

## Scope, prioritize and ping!

Incoming discussions can be pretty raw so before they are unleashed to the team work with a [BOARDLOARD](https://docs.thinktandem.io/manifesto/org.html) (Director of Operations) to make sure the issue is well scoped and prioritized.

This ensures discussions at a minimum advance our [core mission](https://docs.thinktandem.io/manifesto/) and ideally satisfy [a goal we have this or next quarter](https://docs.thinktandem.io/manifesto/roadmap.html) eg we are focusing on the right things at the right times.

This also ensure we've bitten off something we can chew. Remember that most discussions are advanced slowly, over time and asynchronously. We want _most_ comments to be short and focused on a single thing. The occasional long form essay may be appropriate at times but we should not be writing Moby Dick together.

Once things are [in their rightful state](https://youtu.be/FaOSCASqLsE?t=31) we can bring in relevant people via pings and let the fireworks fly!

Generally the BOARDLORD will scan new discussions and tasks and engage without you needing to do anything beyond completing this ticket, however, if you feel like the discussion has languished feel free to send a friendly ping!

## Follow up tasks

If this discussion spawns additional tickets it might be worth dropping them here once they are ready to go.

> Example:
> - [ ] #12
> - [ ] #48
