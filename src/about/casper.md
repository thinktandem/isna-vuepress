She is author of the award-winning and groundbreaking book, [The Making of the Unborn Patient: A Social Anatomy of Fetal Surgery][1], which examines the rise of the controversial practice of operating on unborn babies. Framing fetal surgery as a women’s health issue, she addresses profound questions about society’s compulsion to normalize its members, especially those at the beginnings of life, and to subject otherwise healthy individuals to risky medical treatment.
