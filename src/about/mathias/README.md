[![Adam Mathias](/files/images/adam.jpg)][2]  
**Adam Mathias** joined the board of ISNA with an impressive list of credentials and passion for our mission. Adam first learned of ISNA’s work when his sister, Robin, fell in love with ISNA founder Cheryl Chase. Having Cheryl as a family member, witnessing the progress ISNA has made over the years, and having a deep and personal understanding of the struggles sexual minorities face because of his own identity as a gay man, Adam decided to volunteer his energy and skills toward advancing ISNA’s mission. An accomplished playwright and fundraiser, Adam has produced and managed advertising and media for his own play and helped many non-profit theater groups raise funds. In addition to his creative talents and fundraising abilities, Adam has several years of educational experience teaching people to use software and conduct effective telephone outreach. A patient, supportive, and hardworking colleague, Adam worked with his fellow Board members to ensure a vibrant future for ISNA and its groundbreaking work.
