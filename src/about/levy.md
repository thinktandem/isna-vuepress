<p>\*Sydney Levy\* served as <span class="caps">ISNA</span>’s Board Secretary and Treasurer. Born in Venezuela and schooled in Israel, Sydney speaks Spanish and Hebrew as well as English. An immigrant himself, he belongs to a family of immigrants where each of the last three generations was raised on a different continent. Sydney has worked with the Bar Association of San Francisco assisting low-income <span class="caps">HIV</span>-positive immigrants overcome the <span class="caps">HIV</span> exclusion. As Coordinator of the Asylum Project of the <a href="http://www.iglhrc.org/site/iglhrc/" title="IGLHRC">International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission</a>, Sydney worked with hundreds of <span class="caps">GLBT</span> and <span class="caps">HIV</span>-positive immigrants and asylum seekers in the US and abroad, supporting their claims with human rights documentation and — though not a lawyer himself — helping to demystify the law and make it a bit more understandable and accessible.</p>
