**Rebecca Baughman Kerns** is board treasurer. &#8220;I hope that those I contact through <span class="caps">ISNA</span> see giving to this fabulous organization as I do; a chance to share the necessary resources and talents that we all have to make <span class="caps">ISNA</span> stronger, wiser and more relevant. When one gives to <span class="caps">ISNA</span>, you are giving to the future of better education, understanding and treatment of those with disorders of sex development. Giving to <span class="caps">ISNA</span> helps to ensure that a better future is available for the lives of families and children born with disorders of sex development.&#8221; Rebecca has seven years of experience in non-profit fundraising for various health organizations, as well as five years of marketing experience. Rebecca currently serves as president of the Androgen Insensitivity Support Group. &#8220;I am always ecstatic to listen to the stories I hear while working with <span class="caps">ISNA</span>. The strength and courage of those I speak with makes this work a joy. I cannot think of an organization that would make me more proud and content with the work that I do.&#8221;
