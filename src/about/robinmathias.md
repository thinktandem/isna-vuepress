[image:956 class=bio_image]\n\n\*Robin Mathias\* helped <span class="caps">ISNA</span> incorporate and grow into the organization it is today. Robin is Executive Consultant for [FourThought Group, Inc.][1], where she is creating best practices for Medicaid policy, systems and operations. Robin&#8217;s own website, [MathiasConsulting.com][2] is a valuable resource for the insurance industry and publicly financed healthcare programs in their fight to dramatically decrease the expenses caused by healthcare fraud. She speaks about Medicaid reform and healthcare fraud and abuse at conferences nationwide, including the Medicaid Managed Care Congress, Managing Managed Care Claims, and Association of Certified Fraud Examiner’s Insurance Fraud Conference. She is interviewed in the media and made her television debut on <span class="caps">CNBC</span> in a live interview about alleged healthcare fraud at Tenet Hospitals. Robin is a board member for the [Gay and Lesbian Medical Association][3]&#8217;s involvement with <span class="caps">ISNA</span> has certainly been life-changing. &#8220;In addition to all the changes to my personal life since I met Cheryl, my experience with <span class="caps">ISNA</span> has greatly enhanced my professional life. Working with <span class="caps">ISNA</span>, I learned how to become a prominent player in my field.&#8221;\n\nRobin lives with Cheryl, Scout the Dog, horses and chickens on their farm in Northern California.
