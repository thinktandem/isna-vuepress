======================

Classification: [Emeritus][3]

**Rebecca Baughman Kerns** is board treasurer. “I hope that those I contact through ISNA see giving to this fabulous organization as I do; a chance to share the necessary resources and talents that we all have to make ISNA stronger, wiser and more relevant. When one gives to ISNA, you are giving to the future of better education, understanding and treatment of those with disorders of sex development. Giving to ISNA helps to ensure that a better future is available for the lives of families and children born with disorders of sex development.” Rebecca has seven years of experience in non-profit fundraising for various health organizations, as well as five years of marketing experience. Rebecca currently serves as president of the Androgen Insensitivity Support Group. “I am always ecstatic to listen to the stories I hear while working with ISNA. The strength and courage of those I speak with makes this work a joy. I cannot think of an organization that would make me more proud and content with the work that I do.”
