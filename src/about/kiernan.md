Colleen graduated with High Honors from Michigan State University in 2005 with degrees from the Honors College and Science and Technology Studies, and with course specializations in Bioethics, Humanities, and Society, and Peace and Justice Studies. Her interests focus on the intersection of public health and human rights work. A native of Joliet, Illinois, Colleen has worked as a volunteer sex educator for the Michigan&#8217;s Ingham County Health Department, focusing on young people aged 11-21, and as a research assistant for an educational training grant at Michigan State University&#8217;s College of Human Medicine. In 2003 she decided to take a year&#8217;s absence from school to do volunteer work in Tanzania, where she functioned as a caregiver in a home for children orphaned by the <span class="caps">AIDS</span> epidemic, and as teaching assistant in a school for children with autism. She also spent several months in South Africa doing clinical research and patient education at the Perinatal <span class="caps">HIV</span> Research Unit of the Chris-Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto. In the summer of 2005, in addition to her duties at <span class="caps">ISNA</span>, Colleen performed laboratory-based research on pediatric neuroblastoma at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois.</p>
