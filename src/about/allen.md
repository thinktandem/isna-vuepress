Attorney [John M. Allen][1] helped <span class="caps">ISNA</span> through the tedious processes of incorporating and successfully filing with the Internal Revenue Service for 501&#169;3 tax exempt status. This infrastructure allows us to obtain funding via tax deductible gifts from individuals and grants from foundations.\n\nJohn continues his advocacy as the cofounder of the [Ruth Ellis Center][2], a shelter for <span class="caps">GLBT</span> teens and young adults in Detroit, MI.
