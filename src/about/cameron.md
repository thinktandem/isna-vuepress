[image:890 class=bio_image]\n\n\*David Cameron\* attended his first <span class="caps">ISNA</span> support group meeting in 1995 and within the year became <span class="caps">ISNA</span>’s first volunteer! He served as a board member from Dec. ’02 through Dec. ’05. As a person with <span class="caps">XXY</span> sex chromosomes, David has written about his experience in [Hermaphrodites with Attitude][1], [Chrysalis][2], and Alice Dreger’s book [Intersex In the Age of Ethics][3]. As an adult, David was hormonally masculinized by testosterone therapy without his “informed” consent.\n \nHe served as an appointed member to the San Francisco Human Rights Commission <span class="caps">LGBT</span> Advisory Committee and was a member of their Intersex Task Force. This Task Force was the first governmental organization in the U.S. to organize a [public hearing][4] on intersex treatments that involve gender assignments. After the historic hearing in May ’04, the Task Force developed the [Intersex Report][5], with findings and recommendations, and was adopted by the Human Rights Commission in May ’05. David is further advocating for intersex people and taking our issues to the California legislature in hopes of enacting some of the recommendations of the report.\n \nDavid lives in San Francisco with his domestic partner, Peter, whom he met in 1978.
