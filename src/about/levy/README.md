**Sydney Levy** served as ISNA’s Board Secretary and Treasurer. Born in Venezuela and schooled in Israel, Sydney speaks Spanish and Hebrew as well as English. An immigrant himself, he belongs to a family of immigrants where each of the last three generations was raised on a different continent. Sydney has worked with the Bar Association of San Francisco assisting low-income HIV\-positive immigrants overcome the HIV exclusion. As Coordinator of the Asylum Project of the [International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission][3], Sydney worked with hundreds of GLBT and HIV\-positive immigrants and asylum seekers in the US and abroad, supporting their claims with human rights documentation and — though not a lawyer himself — helping to demystify the law and make it a bit more understandable and accessible.
