# Emeritus

Many people have contributed to ISNA's work since our founding in 1993. This part of the website is where we acknowledge their generosity (in somewhat random order).

### [Adam Mathias][2]

Classification: [Emeritus][3]

[![Adam Mathias](/files/images/adam.jpg)][4]  
**Adam Mathias** joined the board of ISNA with an impressive list of credentials and passion for our mission. Adam first learned of ISNA’s work when his sister, Robin, fell in love with ISNA founder Cheryl Chase. Having Cheryl as a family member, witnessing the progress ISNA has made over the years, and having a deep and personal understanding of the struggles sexual minorities face because of his own identity as a gay man, Adam decided to volunteer his energy and skills toward advancing ISNA’s mission. An accomplished playwright and fundraiser, Adam has produced and managed advertising and media for his own play and helped many non-profit theater groups raise funds.

### [Alice Dreger, PhD][5]

[![Alice D Dreger](/files/images/Alice_photo.thumbnail.jpg)][7]

[Alice Dreger,PhD][8] began her association with ISNA in 1996 in response to Cheryl Chase’s request for help changing the medical treatment of people born with intersex. One of the few non-intersex people to become a pillar of the intersex rights movement, Alice served ISNA for nine years, acting as Chair and President of the Board for six years, Chair of the Fundraising Committee for one year, and as the first Director of Medical Education. These titles do not capture the extent to which Alice often functioned as behind-the-scenes glue helping to hold ISNA together. She wrote, ghost-wrote, and edited countless articles, grants, letters, hand-outs, and blogs for ISNA, recruited and aided allies, directed numerous major fundraising campaigns, and played a central role in policy development and advocacy strategizing. She and her husband, Aron Sousa (a member of ISNA’s [Medical Advisory Board][9]) have also been major financial donors to ISNA.

### [Barbara Jones][26]

Classification: [Emeritus][27] | [Speakers][28]

[![Barbara Jones](/files/images/8c60scd.thumbnail.jpg)][29]

I decided to become a speaker on behalf of ISNA due to my diagnosis of complete androgen insensitivity syndrome at age 26. This was not the first revelation which came about when I was 19 years of age and trying to find out why I hadn’t had the normal female rites of passage at the onset of puberty. I had secretly gotten my physician father’s textbook on gynaecology and began turning page after page. I remember sitting cross-legged on my bed and seeing a picture of a nude woman with the black bar across her eyes. She looked just like me with the absence of body hair. There was only a page and a half of information but from what it described, I knew who and what I was — finally.
