<p>\# Recent advances in the genetics of sexual development have shown the extreme complexity of defining males and females from a biological standpoint. There is no one biological parameter that clearly defines sex.  <br />
\# There are differences between male and female brains very early in development. This suggests that sexualization of the brain happens very early during embryonic life.  <br />
\# Laws and policies that restrict the rights of individuals based on their sex are not rooted in biological reality. The definition of sex from a legal standpoint is arbitrary and should not impede the freedom of individuals.  <br />
\# Significant minorities of individuals are left out of simple civil rights because they don&#8217;t fit established categories of sex. Intersexed people are hurt by arbitrary definitions of sex. As doctors, we have a responsibility to care for our patients in more ways than just drugs and surgery. Intersex patients are born with a disability that makes sexual intimacy and thus intimate life partnering difficult. If they do end up with a partner whom they wish to marry, that is a great success, and they should not be impeded by irrational laws about definitions of sex. After all, in many cases, we, as doctors have assigned their sex fairly arbitrarily.  </p>
