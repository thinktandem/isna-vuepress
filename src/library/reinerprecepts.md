title: Ethics of Gender Assignment
---

These ethics of gender assignment for children born with intersex conditions were presented by William Reiner, M.D. at the [Duckett Memorial Lecture][1], University of Michigan, July 21, 2000. Dr. Reiner is a physician in the Division of Child Psychiatry and in the Division of Pediatric Urology at Johns Hopkins University. The title of Dr. Reiner&#8217;s talk was &#8220;How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Unknown.&#8221;\n\nh3. New Precepts\n\n# Sex assignment is never emergent or urgent.\n# We cannot manufacture unambiguous data to replace real ambiguity.\n# We are not medical experts if we do not know the outcome and the good of our proposed medical procedures.\n# The children know their gender identity.\n# The children&#8217;s intuition is the data.\n# Thus, we must espouse what the child tells us is his gender&#8212;medical procedures must come from those data, not to those data.\n# Gender will be assigned at or near birth&#8212;legally and socially.\n# We cannot know if our assignment will be correct, at the time of the child&#8217;s birth.\n# Therefore, we must choose what appears to be the likeliest gender identity.\n# If the children later tell us we are wrong, we shall then adjust accordingly.\n# We must be flexible and patient, and teach the parents flexibility and patience. \n\nh3. Practicalities\n\n# The children cannot tell us until old enough to weild and manipulate vocabulary within syntax&#8212;about ages 6 to 8 years.\n# Yet gender will be assigned at or near birth&#8212;and we cannot know if our assignment will be correct. \n\nh3. The Ethics of Gender Assignment\n\n# We must be flexible.\n# We must be observant.\n# We must listen. \n\nh3. Surgical Realities\n\n# The children will want surgical (re)construction.\n# Surgery is never emergent or urgent.\n# We must not remove what a child may later want.\n# Puberty can be delayed if necessary (eg, 46,XX <span class="caps">CAH</span> Prader 5 children). \n\nh3. Surgical Principles\n\n# Delay surgery until the child asks for it&#8212;based on gender identity.\n# Do not push surgery&#8212;for example:\n\*\* Clitoral hypertrophy may not be undesired.\n\*\* A 46,XX <span class="caps">CAH</span> Prader 5 child may not want the ovaries&#8212;but wait until she tells you.\n** . . .and so on. \n
