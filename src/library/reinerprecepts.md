# Ethics of Gender Assignment

<p>These ethics of gender assignment for children born with intersex conditions were presented by William Reiner, M.D. at the <a href="/events/ducket2000">Duckett Memorial Lecture</a>, University of Michigan, July 21, 2000. Dr. Reiner is a physician in the Division of Child Psychiatry and in the Division of Pediatric Urology at Johns Hopkins University. The title of Dr. Reiner&#8217;s talk was &#8220;How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Unknown.&#8221;  </p>

<h3>New Precepts  </h3>

<p>\# Sex assignment is never emergent or urgent.  <br />
\# We cannot manufacture unambiguous data to replace real ambiguity.  <br />
\# We are not medical experts if we do not know the outcome and the good of our proposed medical procedures.  <br />
\# The children know their gender identity.  <br />
\# The children&#8217;s intuition is the data.  <br />
\# Thus, we must espouse what the child tells us is his gender&#8212;medical procedures must come from those data, not to those data.  <br />
\# Gender will be assigned at or near birth&#8212;legally and socially.  <br />
\# We cannot know if our assignment will be correct, at the time of the child&#8217;s birth.  <br />
\# Therefore, we must choose what appears to be the likeliest gender identity.  <br />
\# If the children later tell us we are wrong, we shall then adjust accordingly.  <br />
\# We must be flexible and patient, and teach the parents flexibility and patience.  </p>

<h3>Practicalities  </h3>

<p>\# The children cannot tell us until old enough to weild and manipulate vocabulary within syntax&#8212;about ages 6 to 8 years.  <br />
\# Yet gender will be assigned at or near birth&#8212;and we cannot know if our assignment will be correct.  </p>

<h3>The Ethics of Gender Assignment  </h3>

<p>\# We must be flexible.  <br />
\# We must be observant.  <br />
\# We must listen.  </p>

<h3>Surgical Realities  </h3>

<p>\# The children will want surgical (re)construction.  <br />
\# Surgery is never emergent or urgent.  <br />
\# We must not remove what a child may later want.  <br />
\# Puberty can be delayed if necessary (eg, 46,XX <span class="caps">CAH</span> Prader 5 children).  </p>

<h3>Surgical Principles  </h3>

<p>\# Delay surgery until the child asks for it&#8212;based on gender identity.  <br />
\# Do not push surgery&#8212;for example:  <br />
** Clitoral hypertrophy may not be undesired.  <br />
** A 46,XX <span class="caps">CAH</span> Prader 5 child may not want the ovaries&#8212;but wait until she tells you.  <br />
** . . .and so on.</p>
