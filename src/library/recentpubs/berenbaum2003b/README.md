# Berenbaum: Management of Children With Intersex Conditions: Psychological and Methodological Perspectives

<p>Rearing children as intersex is not advocated by health professionals or activist organizations (including <span class="caps">ISNA</span>). Thank you, Sheri!  </p>

<p>&#8220;The lack of systematic outcome data makes decisions about genital surgery very difficult. There are insufficient data regarding the functional consequences of genital surgery, but there are also insufficient data regarding the effects on a child of living with atypical genitalia. It is likely that the effects of both genital surgery and genital appearance are not the same for all individuals. Perceptions of and responses to the situation may be more important than its objective nature, and psychological support may help families develop coping strategies to foster mental health. It is important to remember that decisions should be made in the best interests of the child and not the parents.&#8221;  </p>
