47XXY
=====

Classification: [Klinefelter Syndrome][1]

From the “perspectives” section:

> Being XXY or being the parents of XXYs can be challenging and difficult. We each have our own stories to tell, stories you won’t find in the medical textbooks and patient brochures. I want to share some of these stories with you. They are written from the heart by real people, some of anguish, others of triumph. As you read them, please keep in mind that each person is writing about himself, his own experiences, his own feelings. When the writer gives advice, consider that he may be wishing someone had known it and been able to advise him. Equally, their advice may have no bearing on you.
