“We are an international support group providing information and support to young people and adults with complete and partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, and to parents of AIS youngsters. We also support those affected by Swyer’s syndrome (XY gonadal dysgenesis), 5 alpha reductase deficiency, Leydig Cell Hypoplasia, Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, Mullerian dysgenesis, Mullerian duct aplasia, vaginal atresia, and other related conditions.”

Excellent resources at this site, even if you don’t have one of the conditions or gender identities that they address. See their website for chapters around the world, including US and Canada. There’s a search box at the bottom of the home page.
