The KSA has been supporting people in the UK with Klinefelter’s Syndrome (KS), and their families and friends, since 1990. Our members are about as diverse as in any other support group; as well as those with Klinefelter’s Syndrome themselves, we have parents, grandparents, wives, brothers, sisters, carers and friends.
