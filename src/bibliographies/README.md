# Bibliographies

[Access References Section of DSD Guidelines][2]

Classification: [Bibliographies][3]

The [References Section][4] of [Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Disorders of Sex Development in Childhood][5] is an excellent bibliographic resource, with many clickable links. Depending upon what you are looking for, this may be more manageable than the larger bibliography hosted here at [ISNA][6].

[Medicalization of Intersexuality: History Resources][24]
---------------------------------------------------------

Classification: [Bibliographies][25] | [History][26] | [Library][27]

Most of the history of medicalization of intersexuality has yet to be investigated. This is pretty close to a complete list of the sources available as of July, 2000.

Some of these books are out of print; if not available at your library, you can often find them available for purchase via [ABE Books][28].

### Late Victorian Period

*   Dreger, Alice Domurat. 1998. [Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex][29]. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. Focusing on events in France and Britain in the late 19th century, Dreger takes us inside doctors’ chambers to see how and why medical and scientific men construed sex, gender, and sexuality as they did, and especially how intersexed bodies—when combined with social exigencies—forced peculiar constructions.
