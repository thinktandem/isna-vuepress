<p>Dr. Dreger&#8217;s initial work on intersex was historical, however, when people born intersexed contacted her in 1996 to ask assistance in radically improving the medical and social treatment of intersexed people, she refocused her efforts. Since 1996 she has been working to redesign the medical standards of intersex treatment to better reflect the needs of intersex families.  </p>
