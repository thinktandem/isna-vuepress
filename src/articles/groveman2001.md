title: Lifting the Curse
---

Groveman, S.A. 2001. Lifting the Curse (letter). Discover, March.\n\n&#8220;The Curse of the Garcias&#8221; [Vital Signs, December] tells readers about the rare medical condition androgen insensitivity syndrome (<span class="caps">AIS</span>). Unfortunately, the one person author Dr. Robert Marion chose not to so educate was his own patient. While Dr. Marion may think he was protecting her by withholding information, he instead placed her at risk of discovering it on her own without appropriate support or counseling. I know how devastating such a discovery can beâ€”I, too, have <span class="caps">AIS</span>. And I, too, did not learn about my condition from my physician; I uncovered the truth in a public medical library. Dr. Marion&#8217;s approach doesn&#8217;t ensure that his patient won&#8217;t make a similar discovery. In any event, it denies her the right to make informed choices about her medical care.\n\nSherri A.
