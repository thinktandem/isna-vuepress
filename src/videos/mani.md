<img src="/img/store/manistory_c.jpg" width="150" height="134" alt="Yellow for Hermaphrodites: Mani's Story" align="left" hspace=10 vspace=10>\nThis video was produced by <a href="http://www.greenstonepictures.com" target="_blank">Greenstone Pictures</a> and is now distributed by <span class="caps">ISNA</span>.\n\nA documentary film that traces the life of the intersex activist Mani Mitchell (from &#8220;Hermaphrodites Speak!&#8221;). Frances Grant wrote in _The New Zealand Herald_: &#8220;The documentary&#8217;s strength comes from the fact that it is nearly all told in Mani&#8217;s own words. Strong and articulate, she traces the momentous changes in her life which led to self-acceptance and lack of fear in drawing attention to her ambiguous appearance&#8230; [It] is a courageous and unsentimental account of a person who has confronted and overcome extraordinary pressures and exclusion.&#8221; Also featured in the film are American intersex activists Angela Moreno and David Vandertie.&nbsp;</p>\n \nMani herself says about the film: &#8220;I was asked to make this documentary after a TV researcher learned of my proposed trip to America to attend the annual <span class="caps">GLBT</span> Creating Change Conference in Milwaukee 2001&#8230; I agreed to do this as a queer identified intersex person who believes with passion about creating change. Creating a world where it will be safe, a world that respects and enjoys <span class="caps">ALL</span> who are different. I thought the documentary would be an easy process&#8230; It was not. It became probably the most challenging, powerful, unusual and creative task I have ever done outside of a therapeutic setting.&#8221;\n\nYou can request a copy as a thank you gift when you [make a donation][1].
