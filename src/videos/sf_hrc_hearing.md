title: San Francisco Human Rights Commission Hearings
---

On May 27, 2004, the San Francisco Human Rights Commission held a historic hearing on Intersex issues. It was the first public hearing held on Intersex issues in the United States. The hearing room at San Francisco City Hall was packed with intersex people and our allies. The hearing extended for over four hours.\n\nYou can view the hearing by clicking on the Video on Demand link below or you can purchase a <span class="caps">DVD</span> or a <span class="caps">VHS</span> tape of the <span class="caps">SFGTV</span> recording of the hearing directly from <span class="caps">SFGTV</span>. When ordering, be sure to specify that you want the Intersex Hearing from May 27, 2004. When we checked, the price was $12.50, and they required that you mail a check (they do not accept credit cards).\n\n[<span class="caps">SFGTV</span> Video on Demand][1] \n\nSFGTV\nCity Hall\n1 Dr. Carlton B.
