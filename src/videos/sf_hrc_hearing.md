title: "San Francisco Human Rights Commission Hearings"
---

On May 27, 2004, the San Francisco Human Rights Commission held a historic hearing on Intersex issues. It was the first public hearing held on Intersex issues in the United States. The hearing room at San Francisco City Hall was packed with intersex people and our allies. The hearing extended for over four hours.<br><br>You can view the hearing by clicking on the Video on Demand link below or you can purchase a <span class="caps">DVD</span> or a <span class="caps">VHS</span> tape of the <span class="caps">SFGTV</span> recording of the hearing directly from <span class="caps">SFGTV</span>.
