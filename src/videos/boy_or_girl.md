<img src="/img/books/discovery.jpg" width="200" height="270" alt="Is It a Boy or a Girl?" align="left" hspace=10 vspace=10>\nThis one-hour documentary was nominated for a <span class="caps">GLAAD</span> award for Outstanding TV Journalism.\n\nFrom the moment of birth, everybody wants to know is it a boy or a girl? This question can be complicated when a third option is introduced; one out of every two thousand children in America is born intersexual. Sometimes biology malfunctions and children are born with mixed sexual characteristics, in what is called an intersexual birth.\n\nMany argue that the standard practice of sexual assignment by surgery in infancy should be discontinued giving the intersexual the right to chose or not to chose surgery once that person reaches adolescence. But whatever the surgical choice, intersexuals show us that gender is infinitely more complex than shape of our genitals.\n\nYou can request a copy as a thank you gift when you [make a donation][1].
