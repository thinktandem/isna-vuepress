# XXXY - A short documentary about intersex (online)

<p>In 2000, the short documentary &#8220;<span class="caps">XXXY</span>&#8221; by San Francisco film makers Porter Gale &amp; Laleh Soomekh made the rounds of film festivals in the U.S. and internationally, to great acclaim. Clitorectomy and other forms of sexually mutilating genital surgery are a reality here and now for children born with a clitoris that doctors or parents think is &#8220;too big.&#8221; In this short documentary, Kristi Bruce and Howard Devore, both born intersex, talk eloquently and straightforwardly about their experience of a medical model based upon shame, secrecy, and forced &#8220;normalization.&#8221; Physician Jorge Daaboul (Director of Pediatric Endocrinology at Oakland Children&#8217;s Hospital in California) joins their call for an end to secrecy and mutilating genital surgery on intersex children.  </p>
