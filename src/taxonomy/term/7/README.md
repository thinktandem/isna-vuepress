What We're Reading

["Ambiguous Sex"--or Ambivalent Medicine?][11]
----------------------------------------------

Classification: [Library][12]

by Alice Domurat Dreger

Republished with kind permission from _The Hastings Center Report_ May/Jun 1998, Volume 28, Issue 3 Pages 24-35.

**Subject terms:** “Medical ethics,” Surgery, Sexes, Reproductive system, Child development, Babies

### Abstract

Ethical issues in the treatment of intersexuality are examined. It is not at all clear if all or even most of the intersex surgeries done today involve what would legally and ethically constitute informed consent.

Copyright © The Hastings Center May/Jun 1998

What makes us “female” or “male,” “girls” or “boys,” “women” or “men”—our chromosomes, our genitalia, how we (and others) are brought up to think about ourselves, or all of the above? One of the first responses to the birth of a child of ambiguous sex by clinicians, and parents, is to seek to “disambiguate” the situation: to assign the newborn’s identity as either female or male, surgically modify the child’s genitalia to conform believably to that sex identity, and provide other medical treatment (such as hormones) to reinforce the gender decided upon. The assumptions that underly efforts to “normalize” intersexual individuals and the ethics of “treatment” for intersexuality merit closer examination than they generally receive.
