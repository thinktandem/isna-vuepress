---

The Intersex Society of North America (<span class="caps">ISNA</span>) is devoted to systemic change to end shame, secrecy, and unwanted genital surgeries for people born with an anatomy that someone decided is not standard for male or female.<br><br>We have learned from listening to individuals and families dealing with intersex that:<br><br>Intersexuality is primarily a problem of stigma and trauma, not gender.<br><br>\* Parents&#8217; distress must not be treated by surgery on the child.<br>\* Professional mental health care is essential.<br>\* Honest, complete disclosure is good medicine.<br>\* All children should be assigned as boy or girl, without early surgery.<br><br>We invite you to [learn more about our agenda][1]. If you&#8217;d like to help us push to have all medical care providers move to the [Patient-Centered model of care][2] for intersex, please [make a donation][3]. With your help, we can make the world a safer place for families dealing with intersex conditions.
