# What is ISNA's mission?

<p>The Intersex Society of North America (<span class="caps">ISNA</span>) is devoted to systemic change to end shame, secrecy, and unwanted genital surgeries for people born with an anatomy that someone decided is not standard for male or female.  </p>

<p>We have learned from listening to individuals and families dealing with intersex that:  </p>

<p>Intersexuality is primarily a problem of stigma and trauma, not gender.  </p>

<ul>
	<li>Parents&#8217; distress must not be treated by surgery on the child.</li>
	<li>Professional mental health care is essential.</li>
	<li>Honest, complete disclosure is good medicine.</li>
	<li>All children should be assigned as boy or girl, without early surgery.</li>
</ul>

<p>We invite you to <a href="/agenda">learn more about our agenda</a>. If you&#8217;d like to help us push to have all medical care providers move to the <a href="/compare">Patient-Centered model of care</a> for intersex, please <a href="/donate">make a donation</a>. With your help, we can make the world a safer place for families dealing with intersex conditions.</p>
