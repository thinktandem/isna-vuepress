title: What is ISNA's mission?
---

The Intersex Society of North America (<span class="caps">ISNA</span>) is devoted to systemic change to end shame, secrecy, and unwanted genital surgeries for people born with an anatomy that someone decided is not standard for male or female.\n\nWe have learned from listening to individuals and families dealing with intersex that:\n\nIntersexuality is primarily a problem of stigma and trauma, not gender.\n\n\* Parents&#8217; distress must not be treated by surgery on the child.\n\* Professional mental health care is essential.\n\* Honest, complete disclosure is good medicine.\n\* All children should be assigned as boy or girl, without early surgery.\n\nWe invite you to [learn more about our agenda][1]. If you&#8217;d like to help us push to have all medical care providers move to the [Patient-Centered model of care][2] for intersex, please [make a donation][3]. With your help, we can make the world a safer place for families dealing with intersex conditions.
