	<li>&#8220;Infants raised as girls will usually require clitoral reduction&#8230;&#8221;</li>
	<li>&#8220;A low-lying vagina can be exteriorized at the initial surgery, but in other cases this is best deferred until 1 year of age and often later&#8230; Additional surgery is often necessary.&#8221;</li>
	<li>&#8220;Correction of chordee and urethroplasty in boys with hypospadias is usually performed between 6 and 18 months of age, usually in 1 stage as an outpatient procedure.&#8221;</li>
