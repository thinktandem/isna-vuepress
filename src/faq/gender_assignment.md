title: How can you assign a gender (boy or girl) without surgery?
---

When you assign a child a gender as boy or girl, what you&#8217;re doing is labeling them a boy or girl. That&#8217;s it. You don&#8217;t need a surgeon for that.\n\nBut how do you pick a child&#8217;s gender if she or he is intersex?\n\nThe child is assigned a gender as boy or girl after tests (hormonal, genetic, radiological) have been done and the parents have consulted with the doctors on which gender the child is more likely to feel as she or he grows up. \n\nWe know, for example, that the vast majority of children with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome grow up to feel female, and that many children with cloacal exstrophy and XY chromosomes will grow up to feel male.\n\nWhy shouldn&#8217;t children with intersex be raised in a &#8220;third gender&#8221;? We advocate assigning a boy or girl gender because intersex is not, and will never be, a [discrete biological category][1] any more than male or female is, and because assigning an &#8220;intersex&#8221; gender would unnecessarily traumatize the child. \n\nIn cases of intersex, doctors and parents need to recognize, however, that gender assignment of infants with intersex conditions as boy or girl, as with assignment of any infant, is preliminary. Any child&#8212;intersex or not&#8212;may decide later in life that she or he was given the wrong gender assignment; but children with certain intersex conditions have significantly higher rates of gender transition than the general population, with or without treatment. \n\nThat is a crucial reason why medically unnecessary surgeries should not be done without the patient&#8217;s consent; the child with an intersex condition may later want genitals (either the ones they were born with or surgically constructed anatomy) different than what the doctors would have chosen. Surgically constructed genitals are extremely difficult if not impossible to &#8220;undo,&#8221; and children altered at birth or in infancy are largely stuck with what doctors give them.\n
