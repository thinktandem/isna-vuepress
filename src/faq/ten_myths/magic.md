<span class="caps">MYTH</span> #3: Corrective cosmetic surgeries make parents forget their kid was born different and undoes all their confusion, shame, guilt, and fear.\n\nHello? This might work if the surgery being done was a lobotomy on the parents. &#8220;Normalizing&#8221; surgery just gives parents this message: Your kid is a freak, we had to correct it, don&#8217;t talk to anyone about it because this is a really scary, shameful condition.\n\nThere is no question that the parents I talk with whose children had &#8220;normalizing&#8221; surgery still have all the confusion, shame, guilt, and fear after the surgery. Some parents say they are even worse off. Some have ended up with disabled kids. Others have wound up with more guilt after realizing they risked their children&#8217;s sexual function and fertility. Many worry openly that their kids will later accuse them of not accepting them as they were.\n\nI don&#8217;t have a smooth transition to the next myth, so let&#8217;s move on to [Myth 2][1] &#8230;\n
