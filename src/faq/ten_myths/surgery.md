title: MYTH #5: Surgery makes normal looking genitals.
---

This simply isn&#8217;t true in the vast majority of cases. As Cheryl Chase, the Executive Director of <span class="caps">ISNA</span>, noted in Intersex in the Age of Ethics, &#8220;Surgery is good at removing structures . . . it is much less useful for creating structures.&#8221; <span class="caps">ISNA</span> believes that medically necessary surgeries should be employed when a child or adult&#8217;s physical health is threatened. We believe that, for example, if a child&#8217;s urine is not draining in a healthy way, the child should receive medical treatment for that problem. But &#8220;cosmetic&#8221; surgeries designed to make genitals look &#8220;normal&#8221; are not medically necessary.\n\nIntersexed genitals are not diseased! They just look different. And don&#8217;t go giving into [Myth 4][1] &#8230;
