title: MYTH #2: John Money is responsible for all of the troubles that have befallen intersexed people
---

Psychologist John Money became widely known through John Colapinto&#8217;s book, [As Nature Made Him][1]. Money often argued that you could make any kid a girl or a boy, as long as you made the genitals look &#8220;right.&#8221; It turns out gender identity is much more complicated than that, but unfortunately legions of doctors thought Money was right and did &#8220;normalizing&#8221; surgeries in an attempt to make intersex go away.\n\nWhile it is true that a lot of doctors justified their work via Money&#8217;s own work, it is also true that burning Money in effigy won&#8217;t make any difference in the lives of the five girls who today had their clitorises cut down by a surgeon who thinks no one can live with intersexed genitals. Every time you sit around and blame Money, ask yourself what you&#8217;ve done today to try to see that tomorrow there will be only four children subjected to medically unnecessary surgeries on their genitals. What can you do? For starters, don&#8217;t give into [Myth 1][2] &#8230;
