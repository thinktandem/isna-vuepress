<p>Psychologist John Money became widely known through John Colapinto&#8217;s book, <a href="/books/colapinto">As Nature Made Him</a>. Money often argued that you could make any kid a girl or a boy, as long as you made the genitals look &#8220;right.&#8221; It turns out gender identity is much more complicated than that, but unfortunately legions of doctors thought Money was right and did &#8220;normalizing&#8221; surgeries in an attempt to make intersex go away.  </p>

Every time you sit around and blame Money, ask yourself what you&#8217;ve done today to try to see that tomorrow there will be only four children subjected to medically unnecessary surgeries on their genitals.
