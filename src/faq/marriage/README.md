# What do intersex and the same-sex marriage debate have to do with each other?

<p>A lot, as it turns out.  </p>

<p>People who are proponents of prohibitions against &#8220;same sex&#8221; marriage think it is easy to figure out who is &#8220;same sex&#8221; and who is &#8220;opposite sex.&#8221; Not so. Check out our <span class="caps">FAQ</span> called <a href="/faq/what_is_intersex">What is intersex?</a> to learn more about how it isn&#8217;t clear, in practice, where the category of &#8220;male&#8221; should end and &#8220;intersex&#8221; begin, or &#8220;intersex&#8221; end and &#8220;female&#8221; begin.  </p>

<p>Lots of people with intersex that we know are legally married. What will happen to them if we end up with simplistic notions of sex?  </p>

<p>And lots of people with intersex we know can&#8217;t get legally married, because some doctor decided for them which sex they would count as forever more. Why should a doctor get to decide who you can grow up to marry?  </p>
