title: "What do doctors do now when they encounter a patient with intersex?"
---

So far as we can tell, most medical centers still practice the [concealment-centered model of care][1] that grew out of Hopkins&#8217; [optimum gender of rearing][2] system. We still hear many reports of &#8220;normalizing&#8221; (medically unnecessary) genital surgeries and hormone treatments that were not consented to by the patient, and of adult patients and parents of minors being denied medical records.<br><br>What we heard at the [American Academy of Pediatrics meeting][3] leads us to think doctors are fairly aware of the controversy surrounding intersex treatment, but are still taking the basic approach of &#8220;cut now, maybe ask about quality of life later.&#8221;<br><br>We are hoping to obtain funding soon for an Audit of Care project which would allow us to visit several medical centers claiming to use a more [patient-centered][4] model of care. We hope to find out that they are, in fact, doing progressive work, because if they are, we can hold them up as models of leadership. <br>
