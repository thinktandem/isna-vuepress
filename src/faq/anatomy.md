title: "Show me how intersex anatomy develops"
---

The [Child Physiology website][1] has a very clear animation showing how fetus&#8217;s sexual antomy develops. If you click &#8220;genitals&#8221; on the left, then &#8220;genital formation&#8221; on the left, you&#8217;ll find an animation that shows how boy genitals and girl genitals start out looking the same (from conception to week 7), then develop along different lines under the influence of hormones. If the fetus has an unusual level of certain hormones, or an unusually high or low ability to respond to them, then intersex appearance can result.
