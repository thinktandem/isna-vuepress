title: "hypospadias"

<p>Hypospadias refers to a urethral meatus (&#8220;pee-hole&#8221;) which is located along the underside, rather than at the tip of the penis. In some hypospadias, the meatus may be located on the underside of the penis, in the glans. In more pronounced hypospadias, the urethra may be open from mid-shaft out to the glans, or the urethra may even be entirely absent, with the urine exiting the bladder behind the penis. Hypospadias is extremely common. There are now many online groups where men and boys with hypospadias, their families, and parents of boys with hypospadias can talk things over.
