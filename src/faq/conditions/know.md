title: "How do I know if I have an intersex condition?"
---

<p><span class="caps">ISNA</span> is working to create a world free of shame, secrecy, and unwanted sexual surgeries for children born with anatomy that someone decided is not standard male or female. This is different from, for example, having a feeling that your identity is different from most women (or men). People with intersex conditions generally don&#8217;t have to search for evidence that they are intersexed; the evidence is in their own bodies. For instance, women who do not have ovaries, men who don&#8217;t have testes, women who have no clitoris or inner labia, people who remember multiple genital surgeries during childhood and scars in their genital area and abdomen, people who have ambiguous genitalia.  </p>

<p>Sometimes people tell us that they have fairly typical genitals, but they think that they must have been born intersex and subjected to a sex change as an infant. Surgeons, even today, cannot create &#8220;normal&#8221; looking genitals, and surgery was much poorer decades ago. Thus, if you have genitals that look like most women (or men), then you were surely born with these genitals.</p>
