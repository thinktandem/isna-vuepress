# micropenis

<p>\*Micropenis\* is a term used by doctors for when a person has a penis that is very small and is completely differentiated (developed like a typical penis) with the urethral meatus (“pee-hole”) at the tip. The criteria for clinical diagnosis include that a person has: a 46,XY karyotype (typical male karyotype); testes that are either descended or undescended; an urethral meatus (“pee-hole”) at the tip of the glans penis (that is, no hypospadias), and a stretched penis length at or below 2.5 standard deviations for age and stage of development.</p>
