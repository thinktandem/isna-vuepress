title: "Swyer Syndrome"
---

**Swyer Syndrome** is also known as XY gonadal dysgenesis. In Swyer Syndrome, a person is born without functional gonads (sex glands). The gonads present in Swyer Syndrome are known as gonadal streaks. These are minimally developed gonad tissue present in place of testes or in place of ovaries. A child born with Swyer looks like a typical female. She will not develop most secondary sex characteristics without hormone replacement (medicines given by a doctor) because streak gonads are incapable of producing the sex hormones (both estrogen and androgens) that bring about puberty.
