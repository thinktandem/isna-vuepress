# 5-alpha reductase deficiency

<p>Visit the <a href="http://www.aissg.org/"><span class="caps">AIS</span> Support Group</a> site for an explanation of 5-<span class="caps">ARDS</span> (listed under Related Conditions), for an excellent bibliography and for information on support.  </p>

<p>Different from <span class="caps">AIS</span>, 5-<span class="caps">ARDS</span> occurs due to an autosomal defect (on a chromosome other than the X or Y chromosomes) and requires two altered genes, one from the father and one from the mother.  </p>

<p>The experience of individuals and families affected by 5-<span class="caps">ARDS</span> in the Dominican Republic is featured in the Discovery Channel documentary, <a href="/videos/boy%5C_or%5C_girl">Is it a Boy or a Girl?</a></p>
