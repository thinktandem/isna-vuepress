# What do doctors do now when they encounter a patient with intersex?

<p>So far as we can tell, most medical centers still practice the <a href="/compare">concealment-centered model of care</a> that grew out of Hopkins&#8217; <a href="/faq/concealment">optimum gender of rearing</a> system. We still hear many reports of &#8220;normalizing&#8221; (medically unnecessary) genital surgeries and hormone treatments that were not consented to by the patient, and of adult patients and parents of minors being denied medical records.  </p>

<p>What we heard at the <a href="/articles/aap_urology_2004">American Academy of Pediatrics meeting</a> leads us to think doctors are fairly aware of the controversy surrounding intersex treatment, but are still taking the basic approach of &#8220;cut now, maybe ask about quality of life later.&#8221;  </p>

<p>We are hoping to obtain funding soon for an Audit of Care project which would allow us to visit several medical centers claiming to use a more <a href="/faq/patient-centered">patient-centered</a> model of care. We hope to find out that they are, in fact, doing progressive work, because if they are, we can hold them up as models of leadership.</p>
