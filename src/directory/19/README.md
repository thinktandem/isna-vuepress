# Other Support Groups

*   [Our-Kids][1]\- The Our-Kids Web site supports the Our-Kids Email list. Our-Kids is a "Family" of parents, caregivers and others who are working with children with physical and/or mental disabilities and delays. We call the list "Our-Kids". While it isn't exactingly descriptive, it avoids the pitfalls of labeling our kids anything but what they most certainly are: The wonderful little people in our lives.
*   [Parents, Families & Friends of Lesbians & Gays (PFLAG)][2]\- Parents, Families & Friends of Lesbians & Gays (PFLAG) is a national non-profit organization with over 200,000 members and supporters and almost 500 affiliates in the United States.
