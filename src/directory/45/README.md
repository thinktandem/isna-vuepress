*   [William Hanley, A.A., B.A.][52]\- \[image:1048 class=bio\_image\] \*William Hanley, A.A., B.A. (Board President)\* has been in the healthcare field for over 19 years, practicing as a Certified Occupational Therapy Assistant. He holds an A.A. in Occupational Therapy, B.A. in Healthcare Administration with a concentration in Non-Profit Administration and is currently working on a M.A. in Applied Urban and Medical Anthropology with an anticipated graduation in December 2006. Hanley's undergraduate and graduate coursework have centered on a special interest in GLBTI studies, especially issues related to the healthcare needs of this population, and he brings this passion and expertise to the ISNA Board. Hanley believes there is a real need for a patient-centered model of healthcare that will better serve the DSD and transsexual populations. He is particularly interested in studies about the long-term effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on patient well-being.
