    Workshop description:
    
    Within gender studies, both transgenderism and intersex have become the cause celebre. Despite this newfound interest, many people have little understanding or have misconstrued ideas about transgenderism and intersex, sometimes confusing one for the other. The purpose of this workshop is to help participants better understand the political needs of transpeople and intersexed people by deepening understanding of the two categories and the institutional issues of both, where the commonalities lie and where they diverge.
