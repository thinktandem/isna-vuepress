*   [Arcus Foundation Awards ISNA $150,000][1]\- We are thrilled to announce that the "Arcus Foundation":http://www.arcusfoundation.org has renewed funding for ISNA with $50,000 per year to help cover our 2006-2008 operating expenses! Arcus Foundation has been a key supporter of ISNA's work since 2001, but this is the first time ISNA has secured ongoing funding from the Arcus Foundation. Created in 2000 as a family foundation, the Arcus Foundation seeks to contribute to a pluralistic society that celebrates diversity and dignity, invests in youth and justice, and promotes tolerance and compassion. Initiated by Jon L. Stryker and Robert E. Schram, the foundation was formed in the belief that all individuals have a right and responsibility to full participation in our society and with the conviction that education and knowledge can be an antidote to intolerance and bigotry. Arcus has been ISNA's strongest foundation sponsor since 2000.
*   [Funding Exchange][2]\- The [Funding Exchange][3] awarded $5,000 to ISNA in 2003. The Out Fund for Gay and Lesbian Liberation supports radical organizing projects working to build community among lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transexuals, and transgender and intersex people.
*   [Gill Foundation][4]\- The "Gill Foundation":http://www.gillfoundation.org, a key supporter of ISNA's work since 2000, awarded $15,000 to ISNA in 2005. The mission of the Gill Foundation is to secure equal opportunity for all people, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.
*   [Individual Donors like you!][5]\- Did you know that individual donors (like you!) are ISNA's most important source of financial support? The strongest support that you can give us is a monthly pledge, automatically deducted from your credit card. Even $10 or $20/month amounts to a strong investment in creating a world free of shame, secrecy, and unwanted genital surgery. [Click here][6] to make your gift (monthly or one time).
