*   [Access References Section of DSD Guidelines][1]\- The "References Section":https://www.dsdguidelines.org/htdocs/clinical/references.html of "Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Disorders of Sex Development in Childhood":https://www.dsdguidelines.org is an excellent bibliographic resource, with many clickable links. Depending upon what you are looking for, this may be more manageable than the larger bibliography hosted here at "ISNA":https://www.isna.org/bibliographies.

*   [Medicalization of Intersexuality: History Resources][12]\- Most of the history of medicalization of intersexuality has yet to be investigated.

Focusing on events in France and Britain in the late 19th century, Dreger takes us inside doctors' chambers to see how and why medical and scientific men construed sex, gender, and sexuality as they did, and especially how intersexed bodies--when combined with social exigencies--forced peculiar constructions.
