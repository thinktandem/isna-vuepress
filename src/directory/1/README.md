*   ["Am I a Woman?" in Mademoiselle][2]\- Press Release: 5 March 1998 Intersex activist Angela Moreno talks about how she was subjected to mutilating genital surgery and years of lies. Physicians who claim that intersex activists criticisms apply only to older surgeries take note: Angela's surgery was performed in 1985, by experienced specialists. The "clitoral reduction" destroyed her clitoral sensation, not to mention her mental health. Angela is now comfortable with her intersex status, describing herself as "a different kind of woman, born uniquely hermaphroditic" and who wishes from the bottom of her heart that she had been allowed to stay that way.
*   ["House" Gets It Wrong][3]\- Last night I was shocked and horrified as I watched the plot of Fox’s popular medical drama, "House," unfold. Fans of the show stay tuned each week to see Dr. Gregory House take on medical mysteries with a sarcastic wit and his own special personality. Last night’s episode, entitled “Skin Deep,” proved that much more is flawed about this show than the protagonist. It was, without a doubt, one of the most offensive and hurtful portrayals of people with intersex conditions that I’ve ever seen. For those who didn’t see the show, allow me to summarize the painful episode. A 15 year old supermodel presents with mysterious symptoms, such as erratic behavior and uncontrollable twitching. Throughout the show, much is made of her feminine physique, with comments about her beautiful breasts and buttocks playing a lead role in the dialogue—even among the doctors. In the course of searching for a diagnosis, the medical team discovers that the young woman has been using heroin and that her father sexually abused her once while he was intoxicated. After ruling out effects from the heroin and possible post traumatic stress disorder resulting from the sexual abuse, House finally reaches the conclusion that the young supermodel must have cancer and a series of scans reveal internal testes that are malignant.

*   ["Our Bodies, Ourselves" Includes Intersex][6]\- At the start of ISNA's life, when "Cheryl Chase":/about/chase wondered why the facts of intersex weren't included in the women's health bible, \_\_Our Bodies, Ourselves\_\_, some people told her intersex was a women's health issue. Kudos to the Boston Women's Health Book Collective for today realizing it is! We're thrilled that the "new edition of \_\_Our Bodies, Ourselves\_\_":http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/ includes a section on intersex written by members of ISNA. It even includes a note about ISNA's mission and how to find our website. We're especially impressed that the editors included an excerpt from the autobiography of our Board Chair, "Angela Moreno Lippert":/about/moreno as previously published in full in "Intersex in the Age of Ethics":/books/ageofethics. Angela's story is shocking and moving, and will help reach out to those \_\_Our Bodies\_\_ readers who have suffered similarly--and will reach out to those who are committed to helping us push for progressive care for people with intersex. And it will be \_\_quite\_\_ a reach since \_\_Our Bodies\_\_ has sold more than four million copies!
*   ["Same Sex" Marriage Panel Discussion][7]\- This just in from ISNA Board Member Thea Hillman: On Sunday, October 12, I was a panelist at a Times Talk event entitled, "I Do, I Don't: Queers on Marriage", a panel discussion and Q&A with me, Patrick Califia, Michelle Darné, Carol Queen, Patricia Nell Warren, and Greg Wharton, moderated by Bill Goldstein, NYTimes.com/books founding editor. The event took place at the Koret Auditorium at The San Francisco Public Library. My statements and responses to questions about marriage and queer culture centered on the failure of language around so-called "gay marriage" or "same-sex marriage." I talked about how these terms deny my experiences and the experiences of my community, which is made up of many sex and gender variant folks, namely transgender and intersex people. I spoke about attempts to legislate marriage based on current definitions of male and female fall apart when real human beings are put into the equation.
*   ["Same Sex" Marriage? What Intersex Does to the Gay Marriage Debate][8]\- Thanks to all the hostility to gay marriage, it's looking like judges in the U.S. are about to start on a learning curve now familiar to the [International Olympic Committee][9]. That's because, to categorize people strictly into men and women--as both gay marriage prohibitions and sex-segregated sports require--you have to figure out for sure what makes a man and what makes a woman. And that ain't simple. In fact, the IOC has given up on what was once called "gender verification." They've given up because they figured out what the U.S. courts apparently soon will: There isn't \_\_any\_\_ rational way to decide, in many cases, whether a person should count as a male or a female.

*   [&#8220;First, Do No Harm&#8221; to Premiere][11]\- May 28, 2003 ISNA's new documentary film, "First, Do No Harm: Total Patient Care for Intersex":/videos/total\_patient\_care, has been selected for the 27th San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival! The film features a group of experts--including Cheryl Chase, ISNA Board member Debora Rode Hartman, and several health care professionals--talking about the trauma and shame associated with "normalizing" practices for intersex. Critiquing the current medical paradigm and exploring a more ethical and humane approach to treating intersex, "First Do No Harm" is compelling, hard-hitting, and deeply moving. It is an ideal teaching tool for students of medicine, psychology, social work, health policy, and gender studies.

*   [Cosmo: Good News, Bad News][26]\- Well, folks, good news and bad news: The March issue of Cosmopolitan Magazine includes a big article on vaginas, called "The V-Zone: A Guide to Your Most Private Body Part." The good news first: We were \_\_so\_\_ pleased to see that the article actually recognizes intersex and other kinds of sexual variation! Fact point #9 tells us "few lips \[labia\] are a perfect pair," and #22 reports "some women "don't have \[a vagina\]." Right on--we're not born all alike! The bad news? Cosmo suggests that the solution for having less than "ideal" genitalia is \_\_\*surgery\*\_\_. Get this: "Luckily, women with this rare condition "\[vaginal agenesis\]":/faq/conditions/mrkh can use a dilator or have surgery to construct a vagina and experience a relatively normal sex life."
*   [David Reimer, in memorium][27]\- We've been trying to figure out what to say about the "death of David Reimer":http://slate.msn.com/id/2101678. Though David was not intersex by the usual definitions, his story was like so many others we have heard from people with intersex conditions: Full of shame, secrecy, and trauma. Punctuated by hope, individuality, and love. Though the "follow-up stories of David Reimer":http://www.pfc.org.uk/news/1998/johnjoan.htm from Milton Diamond and John Colapinto have made doctors stop and think, we know from our work that too many families coping with intersex are still subjected to shame, secrecy, and trauma. This won't change until intersex is recognized as a psychosocial issue fully deserving of team care that foregrounds psychosocial support. But today, it is still primarily handled with surgeries meant to make intersex magically disappear. Enough pity and secrecy already. Let's move toward honest, open care that plays on the strengths of families coping with intersex, rather than on their presumed weaknesses.
*   [Defining Male and Female (Arizona Law Review)][28]\- 28 September 1999 For Immediate Release "Defining Male and Female: Intersexuality and the Collision Between Law and Biology," published in the Arizona Law Review's Summer 1999 number, is a broad examination of the law's treatment of persons of ambiguous sex. Author Julie Greenberg, of San Diego's Thomas Jefferson School of Law, examines binary assumptions in the law and offers a brief discussion of how biology confounds those assumptions. Greenberg then examines cases which have produced legal definitions of the terms "male," "female," and "sex," and analyzes the legislative intent underlying laws which differentiate based upon sex in order to determine to what extent presumed legislative goals are actually accomplished. Finally, she uses the lens of therapeutic jurisprudence to examine the negative impact which the current legal approach has on individuals and on our society.
*   [Diamond and Sigmundson publish recommendations][29]\- Press Release: 18 November 1997 Diamond and Sigmundson publish recommendations Sex researcher Milton Diamond and psychiatrist Keith Sigmundson, whose publication last March of a follow-up which revealed that the sex reassignment of "John/Joan" had been a failure, have unleashed a new wave of controversy. The October issue of Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine published a new article by the pair, which outlines a new model of management for intersexuality. "Some of these suggestions," note the pair, "are contrary to today's common management procedures. . . Underlying our guidelines is the key belief that that patients themselves must be involved in any decision as to something so crucial in their lives."

Dr. Reiner is a physician in the Division of Child Psychiatry and in the Division of Pediatric Urology at Johns Hopkins University. The title of Dr. Reiner's talk was "How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Unknown." h3.

*   [Former Hopkins Psychiatry Director Condemns Sex Reassignments][37]\- But does the Urology Department listen to the Psychiatry Department? "For children with birth defects the most rational approach at this moment is to correct promptly any of the major urological defects they face, but to postpone any decision about sexual identity until much later, while raising the child according to its genetic sex. Medical caretakers and parents can strive to make the child aware that aspects of sexual identity will emerge as he or she grows. Settling on what to do about it should await maturation and the child's appreciation of his or her own identity."

*   [Infant Vaginal Dilatations Continue][45]\- Vaginal surgery generally requires a kind of post-operative care called "vaginal dilatation." After surgery, the tissue tends to get smaller while healing. In order to keep the vaginal opening from closing up, the patient (or her mother or a doctor, in the case of an infant or child) is instructed to insert an object into the vagina, pressing against the scar tissue, on a regular basis. When performed on a child, vaginal dilitation can be emotionally scarring for both child and parent. This is one reason why many experts recommend that vaginal surgery not be performed on children with DSDs (Disorders of Sex Development) -- rather, it should be made available to patients who are at least adolescent, who can understand the reasons for the procedure, and who can do the necessary vaginal dilitations themselves (if the patient is not motivated to do this, then the surgery should obviously not be performed). The surgeon's argument that vaginoplasty can be completed with a one-stage procedure on an infant has been roundly refuted -- follow up surgery will almost always be required as the patient enters adolescence. Avoiding vaginal surgery on infants and children also allows for the patient (as an adolescent or adult) to try manual pressure dilation, which has been quite successful for many women who escaped vaginoplasty.

In its disagreement with Homeland Security, the Board of Immigration Appeals noted that the "facts about intersex":/faq/what\_is\_intersex negate Homeland Security's overly simplistic beliefs about sex and gender identity.

"They have agreed that I--and children born like me--deserve the same basic human rights as others." Chase, who was born with mixed sex anatomy internally and externally, went on: "No longer should we be lied to, displayed, be injected with hormones for questionable purposes, and have our genitals cut to alleviate the anxieties of parents and doctors. Doctors' good intentions are not enough. Practices must now change."

You'll see there how the "concealment-centered":/faq/concealment model of treatment developed at Johns Hopkins in the 1950s spread across the world, unintentionally hurting people with intersex as far away as Australia. An important thing to note: Though the title of this article is "Choosing the Right Gender," being assigned the "wrong" gender (the gender he didn't ultimately identify with) is just a part of Tony's story. He also tells a story of being medically displayed "like a freak", being lied to and mislead, and struggling with his sexuality following his medical treatment.

Marcia says the Oprah show is an important milestone in talking about a condition that caused so much shame that her family and doctor hid the truth from her. She didn't learn that she had XY chromosomes until she read her own medical records at age 35. "I hope there will be other girls like me out there watching this and knowing they aren't alone,'' she said.

Early this year, a U.S. District Court judge found that 438 days of confinement in Pod Three, a maximum security four-cell segregated area that is used to house the Wyoming Women's Center worst inmates, was not cruel an unusual punishment. Dimarco was found guilty of passing six bad checks, totalling $742.85. That's not why she was confined all alone for over a year. Rather, prison officials decided to segregate her when they discovered that she was intersexed. Dusen, Matthew Van. 2004. Separate and Unequal. Casper Star Tribune, December 8.

*   [More Evidence People Did Well without Surgery!][82]\- This comes from Christina Matta, author of a very interesting new article on the history of intersex: “Ambiguous Bodies and Deviant Sexualities: Hermaphrodites, Homosexuality, and Surgery in the United States, 1850-1904,” Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, vol. 48, no. 1, Winter 2005. We asked Ms. Matta to summarize for our visitors what she learned about whether people with intersex faired well or poorly in the era before pediatric “normalizing” surgeries became standard practice. Here is what she wrote: To anyone who understands that intersex genitals are not a life-threatening condition, the predominance of childhood “normalizing” surgeries as a medical response to atypical anatomies is completely inexplicable. It is even more inexplicable given that historically, adults with intersex were, by default, completely in control of their anatomies. Even if they had reason to consult a doctor (and those who did almost always did so for reasons that had nothing to do with their genitals), very few individuals were interested in the “solutions” doctors spontaneously offered. In the first half of the nineteenth century, in fact, all doctors could do was tell patients that they were not the sex they thought, and to order them to stop wearing pants (or to start wearing pants!) or otherwise act according to more appropriate gender roles. (In "Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex":/books/medicalinvention, "Alice Dreger":/about/dreger tells the story of a Belgian doctor who, in 1886, exclaimed after examining his patient, “But my good woman, you are a man!”) But this was the extent of medical treatment for intersex, and there’s nothing to suggest that patients bothered to do as they were told.

    NORTH AMERICAN TASK FORCE ON INTERSEX FORMED  
    SEEKS BROAD INTERDISCIPLINARY CONSENSUS ON TREATMENT
    
    The North American Task Force on Intersex (NATFI) has been formed in response to the growing debate over standards of practice for medical treatment of intersex children. Until a few years ago, these standards were uncontroversial. Now, however, the standards face criticism from patient advocate groups. In addition, the story of David Reimer, published in John Colapinto's book As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl, is receiving extensive media attention.
    
    The Task Force was formed by Ian Aaronson MD, a pediatric urologist at the Medical University of South Carolina. Aaronson has, over the past decades, cared for many intersex patients and is the author of chapters on the subject in several medical textbooks.
    
    "We are committed to learn from past mistakes in order to offer the best advice and treatment to our patients in the future," said Aaronson. "Long term outcome data is very sparse and selective, and this puts surgeons on tenuous ethical grounds. I was very gratified at the positive response from members of the professional community and the patient advocate groups to the notion of forming a Task Force."
    
    NATFI brings together specialists in surgery, endocrinology, psychology, ethics, psychiatry, epidemiology, genetics, public health and representatives of intersex patient advocate groups. With the participation of representatives of the Intersex Society of North America and the AIS Support Group, the Task Force is the first decision-making body on intersex medical care to have included intersex patient advocates. "We are committed to achieving consensus on these all-important patient care issues," said Aaronson.
    
    The Task Force, under Aaronson's chairmanship, is expected to address a number of issues, including 1) establishment of standards for informed consent, 2) retrospective review of the long term psychosexual status of patients treated for intersex, 3) establishment of guidelines for the management of children born with ambiguous sex anatomy, 4) initiation of a prospective registry, and 5) revision of medical nomenclature.
    
    The Task Force, an independent and self-governing body, has been endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Urological Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American College of Medical Genetics, the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, the Society for Pediatric Urology, the Society for Fetal Urology, and the Society of Genitourinary Reconstructive Surgeons.

NOW's action follows four years of intense effort by the Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) and GenderPAC, and culminated in a sometimes emotional address by both organizations before NOW's National Board at the invitation of NOW President Patricia Ireland. "After so many years of silence, it was deeply gratifying to have NOW's board listen as I spoke about the surgeries performed on me," said ISNA representative Janet Green.

The documentary was part of NOVA, the "most watched science TV series in the world and the most watched documentary series on PBS" according to the station, and focused on the biological basis for gender identity. Because it is impossible to manipulate the child's gender at will, the argument goes, children should not be surgically assigned a sex until we know for sure what their gender is.

In a recent issue of Archives of Sexual Behavior, FME Slijper et al report on treatment of psychological problems in a population of 59 children with a variety of intersex conditions. 44 were assigned female; 5 male. All those with ambiguous genitalia were subjected to genital surgery.\[1\] The abstract notes that "Despite the sex assignment, genital organ correction soon after birth, psychological counseling of parents and intensive psychotherapy of children, general psychopathology developed equally (39%) in all four groups \[ie, CAH assigned female, those with testes or ovotestes and ambiguous genitalia assigned female, those with testes and female genitals assigned female, and those with testes and ambiguous genitalia assigned male\]."

The group also seeks to educate other social workers and push for institutional change. This year, the group has focused on ISNA recommended readings and videos, heard Janet Green speak, and debated the issues raised by these materials. On October 22, 2005, group members will present a panel at the NASW-NJ annual LGBTI conference about how their education in DSDD has altered the way they think about gender and sexuality.

So many people now know of intersex, so many care providers are employing a patient-centered model of care. We still have a lot of work to do, but those of you who have helped over the years should be very proud of what has been accomplished. Here’s just one sign of progress: In a recent issue of the prestigious medical journal, BJU International, physicians S. M. Crighton and L.-M. Liao documented the “Changing Attitudes to Sex Assignment in Intersex.” Drs. Crighton and Liao point out that “surgical sex assignment and genital surgery in intersex are increasingly challenged now,” and that “it is not the good intentions of surgeons that are called into question.” Instead, clinicians are finally asking what evidence we have regarding what patients really need to be well in the long-term.

To anwer that, I'll quote from the "Top Ten Myths about Intersex": MYTH #7: ISNA advocates doing nothing and raising intersexed babies in a third gender. ...We certainly would like to see people become less gender-phobic, but we don't think dumping intersexed kids into a gender-phobic world with no gender or with a "third gender" is the way to go. We believe there are two problems with trying to raise kids in a "third gender."

Not so! It is inevitable that some "people born intersex":/faq/what\_is\_intersex will tell us that the "sex/gender category to which they were assigned":/faq/gender\_assignment was incorrect. Unfortunately, it looks like U.S. legislatures are making it harder and harder for people with intersex to assume the legal sex/gender category that they personally identify with. For one example of legislation that can cause hardship to people with intersex, and to their families, read what our friend and ally "Lisa Lees reports":/news/realID on "The Real ID Act of 2005":

This report on the San Francisco Human Rights Commission hearing on intersex comes to us from Peter Trinkl, board member of Bodies Like Ours: On May 27, 2004, the San Francisco Human Rights Commission held a historic hearing on Intersex issues. It was the first public hearing held on Intersex issues in the United States. The hearing room at San Francisco City Hall was packed with intersex people and our allies. At the beginning of the hearing, Marcus Arana, a discrimination investigator with the Human Rights Commission, briefly laid out the reasons for the hearing. He reported that the SF HRC had received complaints that intersex people were being subjected to infant genital surgery for the purposes of sex assignment without proper consent. While he acknowledged that some childhood genital surgery was necessary for medical reasons, such as providing a functional urinary canal, he expressed concerns about cosmetic surgeries meant to "normalize" the appearance of a child's genitals. He also reported that around 1 in 2000 births. The politics of what constitutes an intersex condition is heavily involved in these figures.

This case sets a precedent that could render many people with atypical genes ineligible for marriage. The decision's author noted, but dodged, the complexity of legal sex of intersex people: "I express no opinion as to how the law would view \[intersex people\] with regard to marriage.

    A working group under the British Association of Pediatric Surgeons released a [groundbreaking statement][175] regarding the treatment of children with intersex conditions. Incorporating input from medical consumer groups such as [Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group][176] and Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Network, the report states: "While there is likely to be continuing pressure from parents for early corrective surgery, fully informed consent for such procedures would require them to be aware of the possibility of non-operative management with psychological support for the child and family."

    Each year, the University of Michigan's Pediatric Urology Department hosts a [lectureship][178] in honor of the late John Duckett (a prominent surgeon well known for his hypospadias surgeries). This year, the lectures focused on a single topic: the increasingly evident paradigm shift in medical thinking about intersex.
    
*   [Update of our FAQ's][179]\- To better educate our audiences, we've updated the FAQ's (Frequently Asked Questions). To take a look, just go to "www.isna.org/faq":/faq. A number of spiffy navigation tools have also been added to make your "travel" around the FAQ's easier. Those of you who are teachers will be especially pleased to hear that we've also included a way to access an "printer-friendly version":/faq/printable of the revised FAQ's. Feel free to print that and use it in your classes with attribution to ISNA. To continue to serve the thousands of visitors we get each month--new parents, adults who have just learned they have an intersex condition, clinicians, students, and teachers--we'll keep augmenting, editing, and updating FAQs. (For example, we still need to complete the section on intersex conditions, and provide a segment on the biology of sex development.) But if you know an FAQ we should consider posting, please "send it along to us":/about/contact.
*   [Urologists: Agonize over whether to cut, then cut the way I’m telling you][180]\- The American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Urology meeting in San Francisco on Monday, Oct. 11, showed evidence that just about every aspect of intersex care is now in question, but that, despite theoretical turmoil, many medical centers are continuing to provide scientifically and ethically questionable care. Most notably--as we detail below--even though several leaders in pediatric urology urged colleagues to employ less invasive cosmetic genital surgeries, several presenters sent the troubling message that early, aggressive surgeries are necessary (despite a black hole of supporting evidence or ethical analysis).

When she four months old, Driver's doctors removed her entire clitoris because it was unusually large for a baby girl, and, following doctor's orders, her mother never told her. As a teenager, Driver never fully developed breasts and had to undergo a second surgery to reconstruct a vagina that was never there in the first place . . . Llerena, Kim. 2004.

*   [What We Have in Common with the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association][183]\- This past weekend I gave the keynote address at the [American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association][184] meeting in Chicago. My talk was entitled "Facing History: Understanding Craniofacial Care in a Broader Cultural Context." I spoke about how there are common threads running throughout the personal narratives of people born with atypical anatomies, one of them being that what others see as simple "deformities" or sources of stigma are often experienced as livable, integral parts of subjects' lives. The meeting was great; I learned so much from talking with the professional care providers for craniofacial anomalies! Here are a few of the things they know that those of us working to help families dealing with intersex need to know:

In addition, "Fool for Love":/books/foolforlove weaves references to ISNA, Hermaphrodites with Attitude, and PFLAG throughout its narrative, offering young readers useful information about where they might learn more about these issues and even find support and allies.
