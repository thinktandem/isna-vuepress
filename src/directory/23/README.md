# Presentation

*   [2004 LGBTI Health Summit][1]\- ISNA board member Esther Morris Leidolf and Judy Bradford will present "Integrating Mental Health Services within Intersex Patient Care" at the 2004 LGBTI Health Summit in Cambridge. ISNA Executive Director Cheryl Chase will present "What LGBTI Health Activists Need to Know (& May Mistakenly Think They Know) About Intersex". ISNA is not and never has been in favor of three sexes, no sexes, or eliminating gender--but many mistakenly believe that these are part of ISNA's agenda. This workshop will present ISNA's actual agenda, which includes the key points that intersexuality is basically a problem of stigma and trauma, not gender; that parents' distress must not be treated by surgery on the child; that professional mental health care is essential; that honest, complete disclosure is good medicine; and that all children should be assigned as boy or girl, without early surgery.

    Within gender studies, both transgenderism and intersex have become the cause celebre. Despite this newfound interest, many people have little understanding or have misconstrued ideas about transgenderism and intersex, sometimes confusing one for the other. The purpose of this workshop is to help participants better understand the political needs of transpeople and intersexed people by deepening understanding of the two categories and the institutional issues of both, where the commonalities lie and where they diverge.
