She will also conduct a focus group regarding the medical, developmental and behavioral health care needs of your child. She recently received a grant through the American Academy of Pediatrics to fund the planning process for the development of a multidisciplinary clinic for patients with X&Y chromosome variations. This clinic would include assessments by a team including a developmental pediatrician, psychologist, endocrinologist, speech and occupational therapists and other professionals all with expertise in treating children and young adults with X&Y chromosome variations.
