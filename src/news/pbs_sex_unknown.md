title: PBS airs documentary about intersex without any intersex people in it
---

On October 30, 2001, <span class="caps">PBS</span> (Public Broadcasting Service) aired [Sex Unknown][1], a one-hour documentary that centers around the controversy over surgical treatment of intersex children&#8212;without interviewing a single intersex person (except David Reimer, who was not born intersex but was treated in a similar manner). The documentary was part of <span class="caps">NOVA</span>, the &#8220;most watched science TV series in the world and the most watched documentary series on <span class="caps">PBS</span>&#8221; according to the station, and focused on the biological basis for gender identity. Because it is impossible to manipulate the child&#8217;s gender at will, the argument goes, children should not be surgically assigned a sex until we know for sure what their gender is.\n\nHowever, this line of reasoning completely ignores the fact that medically unnecessary surgeries on children&#8217;s genitals necessarily cause physical and emotional scars as well as the reduction or loss of sensation, and violate the child&#8217;s right to informed consent and physical integrity. It is without doubt difficult to be raised in a gender that does not conform to one&#8217;s gender identity, but that is not the only potential problem with the concealment-based medical protocol. See the [comparison][2] between the concealment-based (current) model of treatment and the patient-centered model we advocate. \n
