<p>Due to staff turnover, we are selling an iBook.  </p>

<p>This is a great mobile office solution. Wireless capability makes it a natural for the road, or for working at school or coffee shop. The <span class="caps">VGA</span> adapter makes it a snap to connect to projectors for PowerPoint or Keynote presentations.  </p>

<p>It comes with original packaging and CDs.  </p>
