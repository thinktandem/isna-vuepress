This proceedings volume contains 19 contributions from clinicians and researchers. No intersex people were invited. The editors are with the Children&#8217;s Hospital of Philadelphia. The conference focused largely on gender identity as the outcome of interest, and thus failed to address most of the criticisms that had been brought against the traditional model of management.\n\nZderic, Stephen A., Douglas A.
