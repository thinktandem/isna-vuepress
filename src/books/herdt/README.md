These eleven essays in history and anthropology offer a novel perspective by questioning the place of sexual dimorphism in culture and history.  
  
They propose a new role for the study of alternative sex and gender systems in culturalscience, as a means of critiquing thinking that privileges standard male/female gender distinctions and rejects the naturalbasis of other forms of sexuality. Of particular interest to scholars investigatingintersexuality are: the extensive introduction Gilbert Herdt; "How to Become a Berdache: Toward a Unified Analysis of Gender Diversity" by Will Roscoe;"Mistaken Sex: Culture, Biology and the Third Sex in New Guinea" by Gilbert Herdt.
