<p>This book, winner of the 1991 Margaret Mead Award in anthropology, focuses on the life of We&#8217;wha, perhaps the most famous berdache (a person who combined the work and traits of both men and women) in American history. Through We&#8217;wha&#8217;s exceptional life, historian Will Roscoe creates a vivid picture of an alternative gender role whose history has been hiddent and almost forgotten.  </p>
