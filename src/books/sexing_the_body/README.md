Drawing on astonishing real-life cases and a probing analysis of centuries of scientific research, Fausto-Sterling demonstrates how scientists have historically politicized the body.  
  
In three chapters on social management of intersexuality, the author asserts that individuals born as mixtures of male and female should not be forced to compromise their differences to fit a flawed societal definition of normality. The New England Journal of Medicine has published a [glowing review][1] of Sexing the Body: "A review of attitudes about [intersex] children is overdue, and her book provides an excellent framework."
