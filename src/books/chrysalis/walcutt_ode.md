\_\_Heidi Walcutt\_\_<br><br>A little child was born today,<br>whether it&#8217;s a boy or a girl was hard to say.<br>The poor, innocent mother they quickly sedated,<br>While the doctors and nurses stood around and debated.<br><br>One doctor said &#8220;The penis is too small,<br>this will never, never do at all.&#8221;<br>Another spoke up &#8220;No, the clit is too large,<br>we need a specialist who can come in and take charge.&#8221;<br><br>So the call went out across the land,<br>and when a group of specialists was at hand,<br>A series of tests was the first thing they did,<br>the result of these, from the parents they hid.<br><br>When all of the testing and probing was done,<br>the doctors said &#8220;We can never tell them of their son.&#8221;<br>So the parents were never told of their little boy child,<br>who by a miracle of nature was born to be wild.<br><br>So they sliced and they diced, a new woman to make.<br>&#8220;To hell with the consequences, we&#8217;ll fix Nature&#8217;s mistake!&#8221;<br><br>Counseling next became their obsession,<br>they hounded and pounded into the child their lesson.<br>&#8220;You are a girl, there&#8217;s no doubt of that,<br>trust what we tell you, a fact is a fact.&#8221;<br><br>So she lived in the shadows, without any life,<br>she was constantly battered by emotional strife.<br>Never voicing her fears, her hopes or her doubts,<br>until she found <span class="caps">ISNA</span> and let it all out.<br>
