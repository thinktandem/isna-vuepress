<p>A little child was born today,  <br />
whether it&#8217;s a boy or a girl was hard to say.  <br />
The poor, innocent mother they quickly sedated,  <br />
While the doctors and nurses stood around and debated.  </p>

<p>One doctor said &#8220;The penis is too small,  <br />
this will never, never do at all.&#8221;  <br />
Another spoke up &#8220;No, the clit is too large,  <br />
we need a specialist who can come in and take charge.&#8221;  </p>

<p>So the call went out across the land,  <br />
and when a group of specialists was at hand,  <br />
A series of tests was the first thing they did,  <br />
the result of these, from the parents they hid.  </p>

<p>When all of the testing and probing was done,  <br />
the doctors said &#8220;We can never tell them of their son.&#8221;  <br />
So the parents were never told of their little boy child,  <br />
who by a miracle of nature was born to be wild.  </p>

<p>So they sliced and they diced, a new woman to make.  <br />
&#8220;To hell with the consequences, we&#8217;ll fix Nature&#8217;s mistake!&#8221;  </p>

<p>Counseling next became their obsession,  <br />
they hounded and pounded into the child their lesson.  <br />
&#8220;You are a girl, there&#8217;s no doubt of that,  <br />
trust what we tell you, a fact is a fact.&#8221;  </p>

<p>So she lived in the shadows, without any life,  <br />
she was constantly battered by emotional strife.  <br />
Never voicing her fears, her hopes or her doubts,  <br />
until she found <span class="caps">ISNA</span> and let it all out.</p>
