title: Ode to a Life (Poem)

\_\_Heidi Walcutt\_\_\n\nA little child was born today,\nwhether it&#8217;s a boy or a girl was hard to say.\nThe poor, innocent mother they quickly sedated,\nWhile the doctors and nurses stood around and debated.\n\nOne doctor said &#8220;The penis is too small,\nthis will never, never do at all.&#8221;\nAnother spoke up &#8220;No, the clit is too large,\nwe need a specialist who can come in and take charge.&#8221;\n\nSo the call went out across the land,\nand when a group of specialists was at hand,\nA series of tests was the first thing they did,\nthe result of these, from the parents they hid.\n\nWhen all of the testing and probing was done,\nthe doctors said &#8220;We can never tell them of their son.&#8221;\nSo the parents were never told of their little boy child,\nwho by a miracle of nature was born to be wild.\n\nSo they sliced and they diced, a new woman to make.\n&#8220;To hell with the consequences, we&#8217;ll fix Nature&#8217;s mistake!&#8221;\n\nCounseling next became their obsession,\nthey hounded and pounded into the child their lesson.\n&#8220;You are a girl, there&#8217;s no doubt of that,\ntrust what we tell you, a fact is a fact.&#8221;\n\nSo she lived in the shadows, without any life,\nshe was constantly battered by emotional strife.\nNever voicing her fears, her hopes or her doubts,\nuntil she found <span class="caps">ISNA</span> and let it all out.\n
