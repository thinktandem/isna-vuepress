# What dream? (Poem)

_Angela Moreno_

> look at the child with the dream in her eyes  
> holding it deep inside her _—s. mclachlan_

dream what dream?

the shame-crazed fantasy?

the gut-wrenching, teeth-spewing nightmare?

no dream

no more

can’t afford it

turn it off

the desire

no desire heat tensing thighs rising

none of it

you can’t anymore

nothing but a crusty blanket of

dried blood

where they cut you

go ahead feel it

that unfamiliar

nothingness

where pulp and lust used to thrive
