The drawing below is by Charles Rodrigues. Mr. Rodrigues is a prolific artist whose cartoons have appeared many times in _Playboy_, _Stereo Review_, and the defunct _National Lampoon_. Although we made queries to _Playboy_ and _Stereo Review_ and looked in vain to find contact information in his book _Total Harmonic Distortion_,and even searched the World Wide Web, we were unable to locate Mr. Rodrigues to ask permission to reprint his work. We beg his forgiveness.
