### [Fool for Love][26]

Classification: [Books][27]

[![Fool for Love](http://www.isna.org/files/images/fool_for_love.thumbnail.jpg)][28]

From the author, [Lisa Lees][29]:  
Carys has never willingly worn a dress and Jami, who has, is intersexed. Teenage love is never easy, but for Carys and Jami love is an often terrifying journey in self-discovery and trust.

Carys, a senior, meets home-schooled Jami at a week-long Arts  
Camp where she is clowning (as a tramp named Lovelorn) and  
Jami is helping teach a photography course. Carys is immediately attracted to Jami and boldly sets out to determine if the interest might be mutual. Jami surprises herself by telling Carys that she is intersexed, and so begins a sometimes very emotional process of figuring out what it would mean for Carys and Jami to be in love, and eventually to make love. They continue to see each other when the Arts Camp ends, becoming involved in each other’s activities and interests.

### [Handbook for Parents][30]

Classification: [Books][31]

[![cover of Handbook for Parents](http://www.isna.org/files/images/0-9773201-0-3.thumbnail.jpg)][32]

The [Handbook for Parents][33] (a companion to [Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Disorders of Sex Development in Childhood.][34]) is a resource that physicians can give parents to aid in understanding and adjusting to the child’s needs. The Handbook addresses the many questions and emotions parents have upon learning that their child has some kind of disorder of sex development (called a DSD for short).

Written in plain language, the book offers background information on child development, how to talk with the child and others about his or her DSD, and reproducible information pages to give family and others important in the child’s world.

Common questions are answered, and the handbook provides guidance for preparing parents and the child for doctor’s appointments and the value of keeping a journal.

Espeically insightful are the generously shared thoughts and experiences of other parents and of adults with DSDs.

### [Intersex and Ethics][51]

Classification: [Books][52]

[![](http://ec3.images-amazon.com/images/P/1402043139.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg)][53]

This collection of 21 articles is designed to serve as a state-of-the art reference book for intersexuals, their parents, health care professionals, ethics committee members, and anyone interested in problems associated with intersexuality. It fills an important need because of its uniqueness as an interdisciplinary effort, bringing together not just urologists and endocrinologists, but gynecologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, lawyers, theologians, gender theorists, medical historians, and philosophers. Most contributors are well-known experts on intersexuality in their respective fields. The book is also unique in that it is also an international effort, including authors from England, the Netherlands, Germany, Australia, India, Canada and the United States. The book begins with introductory chapters on the etiology of intersex conditions, conceptual clarification, legal issues, and reflections about the inherent characteristics of medical care that have led up to the issues we face today and explain the resistance to change in traditional practices. Researchers provide recent data on gender identity, surgical outcomes, and appropriate clinical care. Issues never having been addressed are introduced. The significance of intersexuality for Christianity and for philosophical concerns with authenticity add further depth to the collection. The final chapters deal with future possibilities in the treatment of intersex and for intersex advocacy.

### [Intersex and Identity: The Contested Self][54]

Classification: [Books][55]

[  
![Redefining Sex](/img/store/Preves.jpg)  
][56]  
In _Intersex and Identity: The Contested Self_, sociologist Sharon Preves explores how people with intersex conditions experience and cope with being labeled sexual deviants in a society that demands sexual conformity. By demonstrating how intersexed people manage and create their own identities, often in conflict with their medical diagnosis, Preves shows that medical intervention into intersexuality often creates, rather than mitigates, the stigma these people suffer.
