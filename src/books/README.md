[Fool for Love][26]
-------------------

Classification: [Books][27]

[![Fool for Love](/files/images/fool_for_love.thumbnail.jpg)][28]

From the author, [Lisa Lees][29]:  
Carys has never willingly worn a dress and Jami, who has, is intersexed. Teenage love is never easy, but for Carys and Jami love is an often terrifying journey in self-discovery and trust.

Carys, a senior, meets home-schooled Jami at a week-long Arts  
Camp where she is clowning (as a tramp named Lovelorn) and  
Jami is helping teach a photography course. Carys is immediately attracted to Jami and boldly sets out to determine if the interest might be mutual. Jami surprises herself by telling Carys that she is intersexed, and so begins a sometimes very emotional process of figuring out what it would mean for Carys and Jami to be in love, and eventually to make love. They continue to see each other when the Arts Camp ends, becoming involved in each other’s activities and interests.

[Handbook for Parents][30]
--------------------------

Classification: [Books][31]

[![cover of Handbook for Parents](/files/images/0-9773201-0-3.thumbnail.jpg)][32]

The [Handbook for Parents][33] (a companion to [Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Disorders of Sex Development in Childhood.][34]) is a resource that physicians can give parents to aid in understanding and adjusting to the child’s needs. The Handbook addresses the many questions and emotions parents have upon learning that their child has some kind of disorder of sex development (called a DSD for short).

Written in plain language, the book offers background information on child development, how to talk with the child and others about his or her DSD, and reproducible information pages to give family and others important in the child’s world.

Common questions are answered, and the handbook provides guidance for preparing parents and the child for doctor’s appointments and the value of keeping a journal.

Espeically insightful are the generously shared thoughts and experiences of other parents and of adults with DSDs.

[Intersex and Ethics][51]
-------------------------

Classification: [Books][52]

[![](https://ec3.images-amazon.com/images/P/1402043139.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg)][53]

This collection of 21 articles is designed to serve as a state-of-the art reference book for intersexuals, their parents, health care professionals, ethics committee members, and anyone interested in problems associated with intersexuality. It fills an important need because of its uniqueness as an interdisciplinary effort, bringing together not just urologists and endocrinologists, but gynecologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, lawyers, theologians, gender theorists, medical historians, and philosophers. Most contributors are well-known experts on intersexuality in their respective fields. The book is also unique in that it is also an international effort, including authors from England, the Netherlands, Germany, Australia, India, Canada and the United States. The book begins with introductory chapters on the etiology of intersex conditions, conceptual clarification, legal issues, and reflections about the inherent characteristics of medical care that have led up to the issues we face today and explain the resistance to change in traditional practices. Researchers provide recent data on gender identity, surgical outcomes, and appropriate clinical care. Issues never having been addressed are introduced. The significance of intersexuality for Christianity and for philosophical concerns with authenticity add further depth to the collection. The final chapters deal with future possibilities in the treatment of intersex and for intersex advocacy.

[Intersex and Identity: The Contested Self][54]
-----------------------------------------------

Classification: [Books][55]

[  
![Redefining Sex](/img/store/Preves.jpg)  
][56]  
In _Intersex and Identity: The Contested Self_, sociologist Sharon Preves explores how people with intersex conditions experience and cope with being labeled sexual deviants in a society that demands sexual conformity. By demonstrating how intersexed people manage and create their own identities, often in conflict with their medical diagnosis, Preves shows that medical intervention into intersexuality often creates, rather than mitigates, the stigma these people suffer.


[Intersex in the Age of Ethics (ed Alice Dreger)][58]
-----------------------------------------------------

Classification: [Books][59]

[![Intersex in the Age of Ethics](/img/store/dregerethics.gif)][60]

_Intersex in the Age of Ethics_ marks the first time an entire volume has been dedicated to the exploration of the ethics of intersex treatment. It could not be more timely; professional conferences, gender clinics, and the popular media are abuzz with the controversy over how medicine and society should handle intersex and intersexuals. The volume will provide some much-needed perspective. The writings approach the issue of intersexuality and its treatment from numerous perspectives, including the personal, ethical, clinical, legal, anthropological, historical, sociological, and philosophical.

[Lessons from the Intersexed (Suzanne Kessler)][61]
---------------------------------------------------

Classification: [Books][62]

[![Lessons from the Intersexed](/img/store/kesslerlessons.gif)][63]  
Fascinating in what it tells us not only about situations in which sex assignment is uncertain but about the astonishingly weak empirical foundations on which the medical orthodoxies of binary sex and gender are built. A must for anyone interested in the ways widely accepted social beliefs and scientific explanations generate and reinforce each other.

[Looking Queer (ed Dawn Atkins)][64]

Classification: [Books][65]

[![Looking Queer](/img/books/lq.gif)][66]

This anthology collects essays about body image in lgbt communities. Part 7, "Square Pegs," presents writing by intersexed authors Morgan Holmes,  Raven Kaldera, and Cheryl Chase.

[Middlesex][67]
---------------

Classification: [Books][68]

[![Middlesex cover art](/files/images/middlesex_cover_art.thumbnail.jpg)][69]

This Pulitzer Prize winning novel explores the family history and life of a female-reared protagonist who has an intersex condition doctors call 5-alpha reductase deficiency. Born with an XY karotype and sex anatomy that didn’t raise suspicion in doctors or family at the time, the protagonist is named Calliope and raised as a girl into her teen years, until an accident with a tractor leads to an emergency room trip where Calliope and her parents first hear that she has an intersex condition. After being sent to the “Sexual Disorders and Gender Identity Clinic,” Calliope is subjected to innumerable physical exams and psychological tests while she and her parents are told very little about her condition. When her medical file is accidentally left open on her doctor’s desk, Calliope, for the first time, reads about her diagnosis, her XY karotype, and her doctor’s conclusion that she is a girl. After leaving a note for her parents explaining that she is a boy, Calliope changes her name to Cal and begins living as a male.

[Pediatric Gender Assignment: A Critical Reappraisal][70]
---------------------------------------------------------

Classification: [Books][71]

[![](https://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/0306467593.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg)][72]

In 1999, the National Institutes of Health invited urologists to meet to discuss the controversy over early surgeries on children born with intersex conditions. This proceedings volume contains 19 contributions from clinicians and researchers. No intersex people were invited. The editors are with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. The conference focused largely on gender identity as the outcome of interest, and thus failed to address most of the criticisms that had been brought against the traditional model of management.

[Sexing the Body (Anne Fausto-Sterling)][74]
--------------------------------------------

Classification: [Books][75] | [History][76]

[![Sexing the Body](/img/books/sexing.gif)][77]  
Drawing on astonishing real-life cases and a probing analysis of centuries of scientific research, Fausto-Sterling demonstrates how scientists have historically politicized the body.

[Surgically Shaping Children][78]
---------------------------------

Classification: [Books][79]

[![cover of Surgically Shaping Children](https://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/0801883059.01._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-dp-500-arrow,TopRight,45,-64_AA240_SH20_SCLZZZZZZZ_V62138239_.jpg)][80]

At a time when medical technologies make it ever easier to enhance our minds and bodies, a debate has arisen about whether such efforts promote a process of “normalization,” which makes it ever harder to tolerate the natural anatomical differences among us. The debate becomes especially complicated when it addresses the surgical alteration, or “shaping,” of children. This volume explores the ethical and social issues raised by the recent proliferation of surgeries designed to make children born with physical differences look more normal.

Using three cases—surgeries to eliminate craniofacial abnormalities such as cleft lip and palate, surgeries to correct ambiguous genitalia, and surgeries to lengthen the limbs of children born with dwarfism—the contributors consider the tensions parents experience when making such life-altering decisions on behalf of or with their children.

The essays in this volume offer in-depth examinations of the significance and limits of surgical alteration through personal narratives, theoretical reflections, and concrete suggestions about how to improve the decision-making process. Written from the perspectives of affected children and their parents, health care providers, and leading scholars in philosophy, sociology, history, law, and medicine, this collection provides an integrated and comprehensive foundation from which to consider a complex and controversial issue. It takes the reader on a journey from reflections on the particulars of current medical practices to reflections on one of the deepest and most complex of human desires: the desire for normality.
