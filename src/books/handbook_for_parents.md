<p>The <a href="http://www.dsdguidelines.org">Handbook for Parents</a> (a companion to <a href="http://www.dsdguidelines.org">Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Disorders of Sex Development in Childhood.</a>) is a resource that physicians can give parents to aid in understanding and adjusting to the child&#8217;s needs. The Handbook addresses the many questions and emotions parents have upon learning that their child has some kind of disorder of sex development (called a <span class="caps">DSD</span> for short).  </p>

<p>Written in plain language, the book offers background information on child development, how to talk with the child and others about his or her <span class="caps">DSD</span>, and reproducible information pages to give family and others important in the child&#8217;s world.  </p>

<p>Common questions are answered, and the handbook provides guidance for preparing parents and the child for doctor&#8217;s appointments and the value of keeping a journal.  </p>

<p>Espeically insightful are the generously shared thoughts and experiences of other parents and of adults with <span class="caps">DSD</span>s.  </p>
