title: "Sponsoring the DSD Symposium"
---

<p><span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s First <a href="/dsdsymposium2006/"><span class="caps">DSD</span> Symposium</a> is a unique opportunity to reach intersex leaders, doctors, and allied health professionals who are among the worldâ€™s most influential clinicians and researchers working to improve medical care for families and adults with disorders of sex development. Sponsoring <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s <span class="caps">DSD</span> Symposium is also a powerful way for your organization to demonstrate its commitment to intersex issues.  </p>

<p>We are grateful to Gay and Lesbian Medical Association for helping us by hosing <span class="caps">DSD</span> Symposium as a mini-conference within its <a href="http://glma.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&amp;pageID=559">annual conference</a>. This allows us to present the <span class="caps">DSD</span> Symposium by depending upon <span class="caps">GLMA</span> for handling many of the conference details, and also provides <span class="caps">GLMA</span>&#8217;s 400 conference goers with an unprecedented opportunity to share in the most advanced thinking about <span class="caps">DSD</span> medical care.  </p>
