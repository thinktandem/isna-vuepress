title: Sponsoring the DSD Symposium
---

<span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s First [<span class="caps">DSD</span> Symposium][1] is a unique opportunity to reach intersex leaders, doctors, and allied health professionals who are among the worldâ€™s most influential clinicians and researchers working to improve medical care for families and adults with disorders of sex development. Sponsoring <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s <span class="caps">DSD</span> Symposium is also a powerful way for your organization to demonstrate its commitment to intersex issues.\n\nWe are grateful to Gay and Lesbian Medical Association for helping us by hosing <span class="caps">DSD</span> Symposium as a mini-conference within its [annual conference][2]. This allows us to present the <span class="caps">DSD</span> Symposium by depending upon <span class="caps">GLMA</span> for handling many of the conference details, and also provides <span class="caps">GLMA</span>&#8217;s 400 conference goers with an unprecedented opportunity to share in the most advanced thinking about <span class="caps">DSD</span> medical care.\n\nPlease consider supporting this effort!
