title: DSD Symposium 2006
---

In 2006 <span class="caps">ISNA</span> hosted the First <span class="caps">DSD</span> Symposium, a gathering of intersex adults, parents, and allied healthcare professionals. This was a chance to meet and learn from others working to improve the quality of healthcare for families with children born with Disorders of Sex Development, and for adults dealing with the many ongoing healthcare concerns that result from <span class="caps">DSD</span>s.\n\nThe conference took place in San Francisco, at the Parc 55 Hotel, Friday October 13 thru Sunday October 15 2006.\n\nThe <span class="caps">DSD</span> Symposium was a mini-conference, held within the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association&#8217;s annual conference. Registrants to the <span class="caps">GLMA</span> conference were welcome to attend all <span class="caps">DSD</span> Symposium presentations. Those specifically interested in <span class="caps">DSD</span>s were able to register for the <span class="caps">DSD</span> Symposium only, at a reduced rate ($125 thru September 15; $150 afterward).\n\nThe conference is over, but click the following links to learn more about the exciting interactions that transpired:\n\n* [Proceedings][1]* [Program][2]
