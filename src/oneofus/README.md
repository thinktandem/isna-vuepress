Her deeply thought-provoking and compassionate work exposes the breadth and depth of that context&#8212;the extent of the social frame upon which we construct the &#8220;normal.&#8221; In doing so, the book calls into question assumptions about anatomy and normality, and transforms our understanding of how we are all intricately and inextricably joined.\n\n

_One of Us_ includes several discussions of intersex treatment.\n\n\nDreger, Alice Domurat. 2004. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674012941/intersexsocietyo/" target="amazon">One of Us: Conjoined Twins and the Future of Normal</a>. Boston: Harvard University Press.
