Cheryl Chase discusses intersex movement at George Washington  
University and American University  
  


Cheryl Chase, Executive Director of the Intersex Society of North America  
(ISNA), will discuss&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the rise of an  
intersex activist movement working to change medical management and social  
status&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of people with atypical sexual anatomy.  
  


Nearly one in a hundred infants exhibit some anomaly in sexual differentiation  
at birth and one in two&nbsp; thousand cannot easily be labeled "boy" or  
"girl" by a physician.&nbsp; The solution advocated by traditional medicine  
has been to assign infants to a gender throughdrastic surgical means.  
  


Cheryl Chase argues that invasive surgical and hormonal treatment only  
allow parents and doctors to "imagine" that they have eliminated the child's  
intersexuality. As a self described "survivor" of these treatments,&nbsp;  
Ms. Chase points out that the surgery is often&nbsp; immensely destructive  
of sexual sensation and of the sense of bodily integrity.  
  


"I'm sure surgeons believe we're fine because we've been silent for  
so long, but silence is no sign of&nbsp; healthy sexual function.&nbsp;  
It's a sign we've been&nbsp; shamed."&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Cheryl Chase  
  


You may have heard about Cheryl Chase and ISNA in Rolling Stone, Newsweek  
or National Public Radio.
