"NERVE-SPARING" PROSTATE SURGERY NOT SO SPARING.  
  
  
LEAVES 9/10 MEN IMPOTENT

  
  


Common medical wisdom had it that "nerve-sparing" surgery could  
preserve sexual function in most  
  
men treated for prostate cancer. A study in the Aug 6, 1997 issue of Journal  
of the National Cancer Institute reveals that in fact, the surgery is just  
about as destructive of sexual function as the traditional surgery.

  
  


A Harvard Medical School team surveyed 37 beneficiaries of the "nerve-sparing"  
surgery and 12 of the traditional surgery. All 12 of the latter group were  
impotent a year after surgery. So, contrary to expectations, were 33 of  
the 37 men who had the newer procedure.

  
  


These sorts of results ought to be in the forefront of our thinking when  
considering the claims of&nbsp; physicians that current genital surgeries  
are vastly improved over any of the surgeries performed on intersex people  
old enough to voice a complaint.
