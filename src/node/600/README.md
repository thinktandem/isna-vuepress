# Ethicists call for change in medical management of intersex conditions

Frader, J., P. Alderson, et al. (2004). "Health care professionals and intersex conditions." _Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine_ 158: 424-8.  
  
"None of the appearance-altering surgeries need be done urgently. Surgery to normalize appearance without the consent of the patient lacks ethical justification, in most cases. . . . The irrevocable nature of surgery should make everyone extremely cautious."

"However, the . . . view that genital surgery be uniformly deferred until the patient is able to give consent cannot be supported by available information."
