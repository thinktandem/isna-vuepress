_Rolling Stone_ addresses intersex controversy  
  


The current issue of Rolling Stone contains an extensive article on  
"John/Joan" and its implications for the treatment of intersexuals. In  
1967, doctors at Johns Hopkins turned "John/Joan," the victim of a  
  
circumcision accident, into a girl. For 25 years, the case has been  
cited as proof that gender identity could be manufactured by physicians,  
and thus as justification for using surgical convenience as a criterion  
for assigning sex in infants born with ambiguous genitalia.  
  


In fact, the experiment was a dismal failure, and today medical specialists  
finds themselves embroiled in controversy, with their theoretical foundations  
undermined and under pressure from intersex activists demanding an end  
to a model of treatment which views intersexuality as shameful.  
  


The article "has already garnered from subscribers (who get early issues)  
the best, and most gratifyingly outraged, email of any story the magazine  
has ever published," notes author John Colapinto. The journalist plans  
to produce a book length treatment of the strange saga of the twentieth  
century's enthusiasm for medicalizing ambiguous sex.
