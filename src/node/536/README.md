# AIS Support Group Australia

Classification: [Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome][1]

"The Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) Support Group Australia is a peer support group for people with AIS or related conditions, and their families. We support members (both in Australia and overseas) that have any level of androgen sensitivity, and support any issues relevant to living with AIS. These issues include infertility, disclosure, hormone therapy, gender identity, surgical intervention of children with intersex conditions, etc. We acknowledge that the gender of people with AIS ranges from female to men and anywhere in between. We welcome you to our site, and hope you will contact us if you have AIS (or related conditions)." Note: The AIS Support Group Australia is independent of the international AIS Support Group.
