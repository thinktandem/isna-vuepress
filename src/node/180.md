  Intersex Support Group International announces a new ministry based on\nthe True Love of Jesus Christ for intersexuals.&nbsp; I.S.G.I. has been\nestablished from the&nbsp; recognition within mainstream Evangelical Christian\nchurches of birth anomalies labeled "Intersex" or "Hermaphrodite".&nbsp;\nBased in Portland, Oregon, U.S.A., the I.S.G.I. grew out of the godly response\nof one Conservative Baptist Church as they studied, prayed, and responded\nwith compassion to an adult intersexual within their congregation.&nbsp;\nFrom the basic discernment that "being born a hermaphrodite is not\nsin", to understanding the complex web of life thrust upon the intersexual,\nI.S.G.I. has blossomed to become an oasis of Christian love and hope.
</P>\n\n

<P>
  For to long, the unyielding demands of people claiming the name of Christ\nhave over-ridden the real love and understanding of our Creator and Lord.\nAcknowledged in scriptures, both old and new testaments, persons born with\nambiguous or non-existent genitalia have been promised special blessing,\n(Isaiah 56:3-5), as well as understanding of their peculiar relationship\nin a two-gendered society, (Matthew19:11-12).
</P>\n\n

<P>
  I.S.G.I. has gathered a highly respected panel of leaders from internationally\nrespected ministries, all serving to keep the lines of hope and support\nopen to intersexuals, their families, and their church <BR />\ncommunities.&nbsp; The &#8216;Manifesto&#8217; of I.S.G.I. has been published at the\ngroup&#8217;s virtual domain on the world wide web,&nbsp; <A HREF="http://www.isgi.org">www.isgi.org</A>
</P>\n\n

<P>
  In addition to the I.S.G.I. web site, a counseling network has been established\non four continents to provide basic triage&#8217; of spiritual and emotional conflicts\nexperienced by many who cope with this common life circumstance. (1 in 2000\nbirths)&nbsp; In cooperation with established intersexual activist groups\nsuch as <span class="caps">ISNA</span>, the Intersex Support Group International has taken the lead\nto provide insight and understanding toward individuals searching for peace\nfrom their Creator, our Lord Jesus <BR />\nChrist.

<P>
  As intersexuals we have been created unique by God.
