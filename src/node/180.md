<BR /><br /><B>CHRISTIAN INTERSEX SUPPORT GROUP FORMED</B></P><br /><br />

<P>
  Intersex Support Group International announces a new ministry based on<br />the True Love of Jesus Christ for intersexuals.&nbsp; I.S.G.I. has been<br />established from the&nbsp; recognition within mainstream Evangelical Christian<br />churches of birth anomalies labeled "Intersex" or "Hermaphrodite".&nbsp;<br />Based in Portland, Oregon, U.S.A., the I.S.G.I. grew out of the godly response<br />of one Conservative Baptist Church as they studied, prayed, and responded<br />with compassion to an adult intersexual within their congregation.&nbsp;<br />From the basic discernment that "being born a hermaphrodite is not<br />sin", to understanding the complex web of life thrust upon the intersexual,<br />I.S.G.I. has blossomed to become an oasis of Christian love and hope.
</P>

<br /><br />

<P>
  For to long, the unyielding demands of people claiming the name of Christ<br />have over-ridden the real love and understanding of our Creator and Lord.<br />Acknowledged in scriptures, both old and new testaments, persons born with<br />ambiguous or non-existent genitalia have been promised special blessing,<br />(Isaiah 56:3-5), as well as understanding of their peculiar relationship<br />in a two-gendered society, (Matthew19:11-12).
</P>

<br /><br />

<P>
  I.S.G.I. has gathered a highly respected panel of leaders from internationally<br />respected ministries, all serving to keep the lines of hope and support<br />open to intersexuals, their families, and their church <BR /><br />communities.&nbsp; The 'Manifesto' of I.S.G.I. has been published at the<br />group's virtual domain on the world wide web,&nbsp; <A HREF="http://www.isgi.org">www.isgi.org</A>
</P>

<br /><br />

<P>
  In addition to the I.S.G.I. web site, a counseling network has been established<br />on four continents to provide basic triage' of spiritual and emotional conflicts<br />experienced by many who cope with this common life circumstance. (1 in 2000<br />births)&nbsp; In cooperation with established intersexual activist groups<br />such as ISNA, the Intersex Support Group International has taken the lead<br />to provide insight and understanding toward individuals searching for peace<br />from their Creator, our Lord Jesus <BR /><br />Christ.

<br /><br />

<P>
  As intersexuals we have been created unique by God.
