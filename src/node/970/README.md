# Young Adult Novel Features Intersex Character

<p>We&#8217;re pleased to announce the publication of <a href="/books/foolforlove">Fool for Love</a> by <a href="http://www.lisalees.com/">Lisa Lees</a>.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.lisalees.com/">Lisa Lees</a> is a long time <span class="caps">ISNA</span> supporter and <a href="/books/foolforlove">Fool for Love</a> is a young adult novel that offers a realistic and caring narrative about a high school student named Jami and her partner Carys.  </p>

<p>In a world where representations matter and many young intersex and/or queer people seldom see themselves reflected in characters in literature or film, <a href="/books/foolforlove">Fool for Love</a> centers Jami&#8217;s experience with her intersex condition, highlighting her loving relationships with her parents and her partner as well as her struggles against people&#8217;s homophobic attitudes and misunderstanding of what it means to have an intersex condition. In addition, <a href="/books/foolforlove">Fool for Love</a> weaves references to <span class="caps">ISNA</span>, Hermaphrodites with Attitude, and <span class="caps">PFLAG</span> throughout its narrative, offering young readers useful information about where they might learn more about these issues and even find support and allies.  </p>

<p>We&#8217;re grateful to Lisa for taking on this project and hope other authors will follow!  </p>
