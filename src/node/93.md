\nMay 15, 2003\n<p class=m2>\nDr. Ellen Feder, of American University, has written an excellent and important\n chapter on parents and intersexed children in a volume on care and dependency.\n The work is significant in that it is the first account of intersex based on\n interviews with parents. Dr. Feder argues that the isolation of parents and\n medicine&#8217;s failure to take account of their experiences is unfortunate; but\n more than that, parents&#8217; isolation and confusion are built into the treatment\n process itself.</p>\n

<p class="m2">
  That is, unlike some other situations in which parents with disabled children\n are provided access to resources and support groups, the parents of children\n with intersex conditions are treated instrumentally, primarily as the source\n of informed consent to support doctor&#8217;s decision. But parents are not given\n crucial information about their child&#8217;s condition and are not connected to\n important social and psychological resources. The end result is that while\n parents attempt to do the best they can for their children,their decisions\n are shaped within a medical context that privileges expert knowledge over full\n disclosure, and normalization over a child&#8217;s future sensation and qualify of\n life.
