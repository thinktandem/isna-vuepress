MLIS candidate and former ISNA Intern, [John Otto][1] will present the workshop &#8220;Transgender & Intersex - Differences & Commonalities&#8221; at the [Center for Sex & Culture][2], 398 11th St. @ Harrison, San Francisco, on Wednesday, July 19th, 7-9pm

  
  


Workshop description:

  
  


Within gender studies, both transgenderism and intersex have become the cause celebre. Despite this newfound interest, many people have little understanding or have misconstrued ideas about transgenderism and intersex, sometimes confusing one for the other. The purpose of this workshop is to help participants better understand the political needs of transpeople and intersexed people by deepening understanding of the two categories and the institutional issues of both, where the commonalities lie and where they diverge. 

  
  


Participants will emerge with a better understanding of the categories &#8220;transgender&#8221; and &#8220;intersex,&#8221; acquire relevant vocabulary, and develop a better understanding of the political and legal issues that transpeople and intersexed people face. Attendees will have a better appreciation for where trans and intersex issues overlap and where they separate, in order to become better allies.

  
  


Cost:

  
  


$5 to $30, sliding scale. No one turned away for lack of funds.
