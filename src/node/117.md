SPATE OF NEW INTERSEX ARTICLES IN PROFESSIONAL

  
  


MEDICAL LITERATURE

  
  


&nbsp;

  
  


Ann Arbor, MI -- Until just a few years, ago doctors

  
  


who specialized in handling intersexed (children

  
  


born with atypical sex anatomy -- often labeled with

  
  


the quaint and misleading medical anachronism

  
  


"hermaphrodite") were confident that they knew

  
  


what to do. In a model developed in U.S. in the 1950s,

  
  


intersexuality was so disturbing that only doctors

  
  


could deal with it. Intersexed patients and their

  
  


families could be helped only if doctors used every

  
  


tool at their disposal to eliminate ambiguity, and as

  
  


quickly as possible.

  
  


&nbsp;

  
  


The past six years, however, have witnessed a

  
  


burgeoning, vocal, and articulate opposition to these

  
  


medical protocols. The opposition comes from

  
  


intersexed adults who feel they have been harmed by

  
  


misguided and unscientific medical treatment, and

  
  


from their allies in a wide variety of disciplines,

  
  


including medicine, ethics, history, sociology,

  
  


philosophy, psychology, anthropology, and law.

  
  


&nbsp;

  
  


At last the medical literature has begun to

  
  


acknowledge the growing controversy surrounding

  
  


the standard treatment for intersex births.

  
  


Physician's Weekly, in August, carried a short debate

  
  


over the advisibility of cosmetic genital surgery on

  
  


infants, between pediatric endocrinologists Peter Lee

  
  


(Pro) and Philip Gruppuso (Con).

  
  


&nbsp;

  
  


The highly respected and influential UCSF pediatric

  
  


endocrine duo Melvin Grumbach and Felix Conte

  
  


announced, in a recent Journal of Pediatrics article,

  
  


that they no longer recommend that a particular

  
  


category of boys born with small penises be changed

  
  


into girls during infancy. An accompanying

  
  


editorial by Jud Van Wyk, also a well known name in

  
  


pediatric endocrinology, mentions the influence of

  
  


former patients organized to stop the surgeries, but

  
  


fails to provide an accurate name or citation which

  
  


would allow readers to contact ISNA or other support

  
  


groups.

  
  


&nbsp;

  
  


British physician Alizai and colleagues, in the May

  
  


issue of the Journal of Urology, report that they have

  
  


done a long-term follow up of 14 teenaged girls had

  
  


been subjected to genital surgery during infancy to

  
  


remove parts of their clitorises and make their

  
  


vaginas more suitable for heterosexual intercourse.

  
  


They discovered poor results in terms of appearance

  
  


and scarring. Because the girls were examined under

  
  


anesthesia, it does not appear that sensation or sexual

  
  


response were evaluated. Nonetheless, the authors

  
  


characterize the outcome of genital surgery as

  
  


"disappointing," even when the surgery is

  
  


performed by specialists. They call for an end to

  
  


some cosmetic genital surgery on infants.

  
  


&nbsp;

  
  


The July/August issue of Pediatric Nursing carries

  
  


an article by intersex activist Cheryl Chase. Chase

  
  


was solicited by the journal's ethics editor, who was

  
  


disturbed by an earlier article which gave strong

  
  


consideration to using the courts to impose surgical

  
  


sex change on an infant whose parents opposed it. Of

  
  


note, the article is illustrated with a photo of

  
  


intersexed activists who appear in a group, clothed,

  
  


smiling and without their eyes blacked out.

  
  


&nbsp;

  
  


"As much as we would like to think that . . . we always

  
  


assign an appropriate gender to an infant with

  
  


ambiguous genitalia, mistakes are inevitable,"

  
  


concedes surgeon Kenneth Glassberg, in a Journal of

  
  


Urology editorial. Unfortunately, he conflates

  
  


surgery with sex assignment, equating calls for

  
  


deferral of surgery to some sort of demand for public

  
  


assignment of children as hermaprhodites. Glassberg

  
  


cites one ISNA publication, but appears not to have

  
  


understood that the article he cites is satire, and the

  
  


citation he provides is grossly inaccurate and

  
  


inadequate, thus preventing his readers (including

  
  


intersexed former patients) from gaining access to

  
  


first person narratives by intersexed people.

  
  


&nbsp;

  
  


"We live in an age of increasing respect for minority

  
  


rights," notes surgeon Ian Aaronson, in an editorial

  
  


on "The Child with Ambiguous Genitalia" in the

  
  


Journal of Infectious Urology. However, if genital

  
  


surgery on infants were to be stopped, and

  
  


intersexed children allowed to make choices about

  
  


their own lives, it would "signify a return to the

  
  


'dark ages' of intersex management, which has given

  
  


rise to a host of psychological cripples."
