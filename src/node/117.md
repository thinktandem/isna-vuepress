&nbsp;\n\n

Ann Arbor, MI &#8212; Until just a few years, ago doctors\n\n

who specialized in handling intersexed (children\n\n

born with atypical sex anatomy &#8212; often labeled with\n\n

the quaint and misleading medical anachronism\n\n

"hermaphrodite") were confident that they knew\n\n

what to do. In a model developed in U.S. in the 1950s,\n\n

intersexuality was so disturbing that only doctors\n\n

could deal with it. Intersexed patients and their\n\n

families could be helped only if doctors used every\n\n

tool at their disposal to eliminate ambiguity, and as\n\n

quickly as possible.\n\n

&nbsp;\n\n

The past six years, however, have witnessed a\n\n

burgeoning, vocal, and articulate opposition to these\n\n

medical protocols. The opposition comes from\n\n

intersexed adults who feel they have been harmed by\n\n

misguided and unscientific medical treatment, and\n\n

from their allies in a wide variety of disciplines,\n\n

including medicine, ethics, history, sociology,\n\n

philosophy, psychology, anthropology, and law.\n\n

&nbsp;\n\n

At last the medical literature has begun to\n\n

acknowledge the growing controversy surrounding\n\n

the standard treatment for intersex births.\n\n

Physician&#8217;s Weekly, in August, carried a short debate\n\n

over the advisibility of cosmetic genital surgery on\n\n

infants, between pediatric endocrinologists Peter Lee\n\n

(Pro) and Philip Gruppuso (Con).\n\n

&nbsp;\n\n

The highly respected and influential <span class="caps">UCSF</span> pediatric\n\n

endocrine duo Melvin Grumbach and Felix Conte\n\n

announced, in a recent Journal of Pediatrics article,\n\n

that they no longer recommend that a particular\n\n

category of boys born with small penises be changed\n\n

into girls during infancy. An accompanying\n\n

editorial by Jud Van Wyk, also a well known name in\n\n

pediatric endocrinology, mentions the influence of\n\n

former patients organized to stop the surgeries, but\n\n

fails to provide an accurate name or citation which\n\n

would allow readers to contact <span class="caps">ISNA</span> or other support\n\n

groups.\n\n

&nbsp;\n\n

British physician Alizai and colleagues, in the May\n\n

issue of the Journal of Urology, report that they have\n\n

done a long-term follow up of 14 teenaged girls had\n\n

been subjected to genital surgery during infancy to\n\n

remove parts of their clitorises and make their\n\n

vaginas more suitable for heterosexual intercourse.\n\n

They discovered poor results in terms of appearance\n\n

and scarring. Because the girls were examined under\n\n

anesthesia, it does not appear that sensation or sexual\n\n

response were evaluated. Nonetheless, the authors\n\n

characterize the outcome of genital surgery as\n\n

"disappointing," even when the surgery is\n\n

performed by specialists. They call for an end to\n\n

some cosmetic genital surgery on infants.\n\n

&nbsp;\n\n

The July/August issue of Pediatric Nursing carries\n\n

an article by intersex activist Cheryl Chase. Chase\n\n

was solicited by the journal&#8217;s ethics editor, who was\n\n

disturbed by an earlier article which gave strong\n\n

consideration to using the courts to impose surgical\n\n

sex change on an infant whose parents opposed it. Of\n\n

note, the article is illustrated with a photo of\n\n

intersexed activists who appear in a group, clothed,\n\n

smiling and without their eyes blacked out.\n\n

&nbsp;\n\n

"As much as we would like to think that . . . we always\n\n

assign an appropriate gender to an infant with\n\n

ambiguous genitalia, mistakes are inevitable,"\n\n

concedes surgeon Kenneth Glassberg, in a Journal of\n\n

Urology editorial. Unfortunately, he conflates\n\n

surgery with sex assignment, equating calls for\n\n

deferral of surgery to some sort of demand for public\n\n

assignment of children as hermaprhodites. Glassberg\n\n

cites one <span class="caps">ISNA</span> publication, but appears not to have\n\n

understood that the article he cites is satire, and the\n\n

citation he provides is grossly inaccurate and\n\n

inadequate, thus preventing his readers (including\n\n

intersexed former patients) from gaining access to\n\n

first person narratives by intersexed people.\n\n

&nbsp;\n\n

"We live in an age of increasing respect for minority\n\n

rights," notes surgeon Ian Aaronson, in an editorial\n\n

on "The Child with Ambiguous Genitalia" in the\n\n

Journal of Infectious Urology. However, if genital\n\n

surgery on infants were to be stopped, and\n\n

intersexed children allowed to make choices about\n\n

their own lives, it would "signify a return to the\n\n

&#8216;dark ages&#8217; of intersex management, which has given\n\n

rise to a host of psychological cripples."\n\n
