# Evolution's Rainbow : Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People

<p>\_\_by Joan Roughgarden\_\_  </p>

<p>Of all the books I&#8217;ve read recently, I found Dr. Roughgarden&#8217;s book a refreshing and exciting look at intersex and hermaphroditic anatomies within the animal kingdom. The book is divided into 3 parts: animal rainbows, human rainbows and cultural rainbows, which includes a spiritual perspective. It was identified as among the best 10 in 2004 by The Advocate, and has just won the prestigious Stonewall Prize for best nonfiction work in 2004 by the American Library Association. I recommend this book for those interested in nature&#8217;s gender and sexuality diversity and how we as humans fit in to that spectrum.  </p>
