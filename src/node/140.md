<FONT SIZE="+1"><I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> reports on &#8220;true<br>hermaphrodite&#8221;</FONT><br><br>

The January 15 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine carries<br>a report of an infant produced by in vitro fertilization who was discovered<br>to have one ovary and one testis. Genetic investigation revealed the child<br>to have two cell lines, one 46 XX (female-typical) and one 46 XY (male-typical).<br>The presence in one individual of cells derived from different conceptuses<br>is called &#8220;chimerism,&#8221;<br>  
after the mythical Greek monster. Because <span class="caps">IVF</span> implantations have a<br>low success rate, it is common practice to implant multiple conceptuses<br>to increase the likelihood of pregnancy; in this case two conceptuses amalgamated<br>to form a single individual.<br><br>

The presence of both ovarian and testicular tissue results in the child<br>being labeled a &#8220;true hermaphrodite,&#8221; a term which gives the false impression<br>that the child is somehow more hermaphroditic than others. In fact, &#8220;true<br>hermaphrodites&#8221; are likely to have less anatomic ambiguity than individuals<br>labeled &#8220;pseudo-hermaphrodite.&#8221; As Dr. Alice Dreger discusses in her book,<br>&#8220;Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex,&#8221; due out from Harvard<br>University Press in<br>  
April, the distinction between &#8220;true&#8221; and &#8220;pseudo&#8221; was introduced by<br>Victorian medical men as a sort of definitional legerdemain with which<br>to dismiss the disturbing tendency of human bodies to contradict their<br>conviction that each body must have a &#8220;true sex.&#8221;<br><br>

Neither chimerism nor intersexuality are unusual enough to have warranted<br>publication of a case report in a medical journal, were it not for the<br>circumstance that this birth is the result of <span class="caps">IVF</span>.<br><br>

The freakishness implied by the use of medical labels derived from Greek<br>mythology, however, produces public interest. The case report was presented<br>in a Washington Post article, and the<br>  
story inspired the DJ of a Boston radio program was inspired to tease<br>his co-host,<br>  
calling him a hermaphrodite, saying that he engaged in coitus with<br>himself, and comparing intersexuals to worms.<br>
