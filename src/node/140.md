<FONT SIZE="+1"><I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> reports on "true<br />hermaphrodite"</FONT>  
  


The January 15 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine carries  
a report of an infant produced by in vitro fertilization who was discovered  
to have one ovary and one testis. Genetic investigation revealed the child  
to have two cell lines, one 46 XX (female-typical) and one 46 XY (male-typical).  
The presence in one individual of cells derived from different conceptuses  
is called "chimerism,"  
  
after the mythical Greek monster. Because IVF implantations have a  
low success rate, it is common practice to implant multiple conceptuses  
to increase the likelihood of pregnancy; in this case two conceptuses amalgamated  
to form a single individual.  
  


The presence of both ovarian and testicular tissue results in the child  
being labeled a "true hermaphrodite," a term which gives the false impression  
that the child is somehow more hermaphroditic than others. In fact, "true  
hermaphrodites" are likely to have less anatomic ambiguity than individuals  
labeled "pseudo-hermaphrodite." As Dr. Alice Dreger discusses in her book,  
"Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex," due out from Harvard  
University Press in  
  
April, the distinction between "true" and "pseudo" was introduced by  
Victorian medical men as a sort of definitional legerdemain with which  
to dismiss the disturbing tendency of human bodies to contradict their  
conviction that each body must have a "true sex."  
  


Neither chimerism nor intersexuality are unusual enough to have warranted  
publication of a case report in a medical journal, were it not for the  
circumstance that this birth is the result of IVF.  
  


The freakishness implied by the use of medical labels derived from Greek  
mythology, however, produces public interest. The case report was presented  
in a Washington Post article, and the  
  
story inspired the DJ of a Boston radio program was inspired to tease  
his co-host,  
  
calling him a hermaphrodite, saying that he engaged in coitus with  
himself, and comparing intersexuals to worms.
