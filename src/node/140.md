<FONT SIZE="+1"><I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> reports on &#8220;true\nhermaphrodite&#8221;</FONT>\n\n

The January 15 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine carries\na report of an infant produced by in vitro fertilization who was discovered\nto have one ovary and one testis. Genetic investigation revealed the child\nto have two cell lines, one 46 XX (female-typical) and one 46 XY (male-typical).\nThe presence in one individual of cells derived from different conceptuses\nis called &#8220;chimerism,&#8221;\n  
after the mythical Greek monster. Because <span class="caps">IVF</span> implantations have a\nlow success rate, it is common practice to implant multiple conceptuses\nto increase the likelihood of pregnancy; in this case two conceptuses amalgamated\nto form a single individual.\n\n

The presence of both ovarian and testicular tissue results in the child\nbeing labeled a &#8220;true hermaphrodite,&#8221; a term which gives the false impression\nthat the child is somehow more hermaphroditic than others. In fact, &#8220;true\nhermaphrodites&#8221; are likely to have less anatomic ambiguity than individuals\nlabeled &#8220;pseudo-hermaphrodite.&#8221; As Dr. Alice Dreger discusses in her book,\n&#8220;Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex,&#8221; due out from Harvard\nUniversity Press in\n  
April, the distinction between &#8220;true&#8221; and &#8220;pseudo&#8221; was introduced by\nVictorian medical men as a sort of definitional legerdemain with which\nto dismiss the disturbing tendency of human bodies to contradict their\nconviction that each body must have a &#8220;true sex.&#8221;\n\n

Neither chimerism nor intersexuality are unusual enough to have warranted\npublication of a case report in a medical journal, were it not for the\ncircumstance that this birth is the result of <span class="caps">IVF</span>.\n\n

The freakishness implied by the use of medical labels derived from Greek\nmythology, however, produces public interest. The case report was presented\nin a Washington Post article, and the\n  
story inspired the DJ of a Boston radio program was inspired to tease\nhis co-host,\n  
calling him a hermaphrodite, saying that he engaged in coitus with\nhimself, and comparing intersexuals to worms.\n
