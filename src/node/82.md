**Journal of Clinical Ethics Special Issue Focuses on Intersex**\n

The current number of the Journal of Clinical Ethics (v.9 no.4 Winter\n98) is a special issue devoted to the ethics\n  
of medical management of intersexuality.\n

_From the introductions:_\n  
The articles in this issue of <span class="caps">JCE</span> ask how intersexuals should be medically\ntreated, based on what we know now. They urge, above all else, that surgeons\nno longer operate on infants born with ambiguous genitals to create &#8220;more\nnormal looking&#8221; genitals.\n  
Edmund G. Howe, Editor in Chief\n

Without a doubt, the speed with which the intersex scene has been changing\nduring this decade seems to indicate a major paradigm shift.&nbsp; . .\n. In the end, all intersexuals are now asking is to be treated according\nto the same ethical principles as everybody else. This volume seeks to\nexplore what that would mean.\n  
Alice Domurat Dreger, Editor (special issue)\n
