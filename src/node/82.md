**Journal of Clinical Ethics Special Issue Focuses on Intersex**<br>

The current number of the Journal of Clinical Ethics (v.9 no.4 Winter<br>98) is a special issue devoted to the ethics<br>  
of medical management of intersexuality.<br>

_From the introductions:_<br>  
The articles in this issue of <span class="caps">JCE</span> ask how intersexuals should be medically<br>treated, based on what we know now. They urge, above all else, that surgeons<br>no longer operate on infants born with ambiguous genitals to create &#8220;more<br>normal looking&#8221; genitals.<br>  
Edmund G. Howe, Editor in Chief<br>

Without a doubt, the speed with which the intersex scene has been changing<br>during this decade seems to indicate a major paradigm shift.&nbsp; . .<br>. In the end, all intersexuals are now asking is to be treated according<br>to the same ethical principles as everybody else. This volume seeks to<br>explore what that would mean.<br>  
Alice Domurat Dreger, Editor (special issue)<br>
