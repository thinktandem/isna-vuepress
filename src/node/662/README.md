# Washington Square News looks at Intersex

<p>In her early 30s, Betsy Driver learned why she had never felt totally comfortable in her high school locker room.  </p>

<p>When she four months old, Driver&#8217;s doctors removed her entire clitoris because it was unusually large for a baby girl, and, following doctor&#8217;s orders, her mother never told her. As a teenager, Driver never fully developed breasts and had to undergo a second surgery to reconstruct a vagina that was never there in the first place . . .  </p>
