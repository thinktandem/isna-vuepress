  Terry Gross, host of the popular <span class="caps">NPR</span> program "Fresh Air," produced\nby <span class="caps">WHYY</span> in Philadelphia, <BR />\ninterview intersex activist Cheryl Chase and pediatric surgeon Antoine Khoury\nand social <BR />\nworker Barbara Nielson, both of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.\nThe program <BR />\naired 11 December 1997.
</P>\n\n

<P>
  Khoury largely dismissed the complaints of intersex activists, insisting\nthat they must have had "bad surgery," and that surgery is now\nmuch improved. Nielson agreed with intersex activists that secrecy is harmful,\nciting her experience working with adopted children, but concluded that\nsurgery was necessary before a child goes to day care, in order to forestall\nteasing by peers.
