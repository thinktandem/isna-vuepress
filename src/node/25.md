  Terry Gross, host of the popular NPR program "Fresh Air," produced<br />by WHYY in Philadelphia, <BR /><br />interview intersex activist Cheryl Chase and pediatric surgeon Antoine Khoury<br />and social <BR /><br />worker Barbara Nielson, both of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.<br />The program <BR /><br />aired 11 December 1997.
</P>

<br /><br />

<P>
  Khoury largely dismissed the complaints of intersex activists, insisting<br />that they must have had "bad surgery," and that surgery is now<br />much improved. Nielson agreed with intersex activists that secrecy is harmful,<br />citing her experience working with adopted children, but concluded that<br />surgery was necessary before a child goes to day care, in order to forestall<br />teasing by peers.
