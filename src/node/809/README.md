# Cosmo: Good News, Bad News

<p>Well, folks, good news and bad news:  </p>

<p>The March issue of Cosmopolitan Magazine includes a big article on vaginas, called &#8220;The V-Zone: A Guide to Your Most Private Body Part.&#8221;  </p>

<p>The good news first: We were \_\_so\_\_ pleased to see that the article actually recognizes intersex and other kinds of sexual variation! Fact point #9 tells us &#8220;few lips [labia] are a perfect pair,&#8221; and #22 reports &#8220;some women &#8220;don&#8217;t have [a vagina].&#8221; Right on&#8212;we&#8217;re not born all alike!  </p>

<p>The bad news? Cosmo suggests that the solution for having less than &#8220;ideal&#8221; genitalia is \_\_\*surgery\*\_\_. Get this: &#8220;Luckily, women with this rare condition <a href="/faq/conditions/mrkh">[vaginal agenesis]</a> can use a dilator or have surgery to construct a vagina and experience a relatively normal sex life.&#8221;  </p>

<p>And item #10 really makes us want to run to our medicine cabinets for a sedative. It recommends <a href="/node/667">labiaplasty</a> for women with less-than-perfectly-symmetrical labia. Great&#8212;this is going to result in us getting ever more inquiries from women who want to know how to get back the genital sensation they lost to such surgeries.  </p>

<p>Hey, Cosmo! Aren&#8217;t you supposed to be the queen of sexual freedom for women? Why does a &#8220;normal sex life&#8221; require medical procedures rather than acceptance of one&#8217;s unique form?</p>
