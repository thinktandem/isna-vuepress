# Pediatric Endocrinologists Question Medical Management

  
The Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrinology Society devoted one third of its two day <A HREF="http://www.lwpes.org/lwpes2000.htm">annual meeting</A> to presentations on the Neonatal Management of Genital Ambiguity. In an historic shift away from reluctance to consider the perspective of intersex adults, the specialists invited ISNA's Cheryl Chase to close the session with a presentation on <A HREF="/pdf/pt-centered.pdf">Sexual Ambiguity: The Patient-Centered Approach</A>. (This is a PDF file; you'll need the free <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html">Acrobat Reader</A> to open it.)
