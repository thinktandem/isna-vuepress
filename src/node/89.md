        The <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/aissg/" TARGET="_top">Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia</A> (<acronym title="Aust."><span class="caps">AISSG</span></acronym>)\nis a peer support group providing information and support to people with\nAIS and their families. Whilst not our primary function, one of the aims\nof the <acronym title="Aust."><span class="caps">AISSG</span></acronym> is to increase awareness in the general medical community\nof the personal issues faced by people with <span class="caps">AIS</span>.\n\n
        
        The <span class="caps">AIS</span> Support Group is opposed to any unnecessary medical intervention\nwhen treating any intersex condition. Having said this, the <acronym title="Aust."><span class="caps">AISSG</span></acronym>\nrecognises there is still considerable debate over what constitutes "necessary\nmedical intervention" in such cases. The <acronym title="Aust."><span class="caps">AISSG</span></acronym> also recognises\nthat what was considered by most paediatricians and surgeons as best practice\nfor medical intervention 30 years ago may not be considered by some clinicians\nto be best practice now. The <acronym title="Aust."><span class="caps">AISSG</span></acronym> is therefore of the opinion that\nany clinician moving in a positive direction to influence or change best\npractice to improve the regimes for treatment of children with intersex\nconditions should be supported.\n\n
        
        Members of the <acronym title="Aust."><span class="caps">AISSG</span></acronym> have been working with the Royal Children&#8217;s\nHospital Melbourne (<span class="caps">RCH</span>) in an attempt to assist the identification and\nimplementation of world&#8217;s best practice for the treatment of children with\nintersex conditions. Earlier this year, the <span class="caps">RCH</span> announced its intention\nto undertake an extensive bioethics study including 200 follow-up studies\nof children with intersex conditions who have undergone some level of medical\nintervention. The intended Bioethics study has formalised arrangements with\nthe <acronym title="Aust."><span class="caps">AISSG</span></acronym> to assist identification of best practice for the medical\nmanagement of children with intersex conditions. The <acronym title="Aust."><span class="caps">AISSG</span></acronym> hopes\nthat such initiatives that include both clinicians and support groups will\nbe seen by other medical centres world-wide as the only way of ensuring\nthat the needs of patients, their parents and clinicians are met adequately.\n \n\n
        
        Prof. Garry Warne of the <span class="caps">RCH</span> is a keen advocate of the <acronym title="Aust."><span class="caps">AISSG</span></acronym> and\nwas instrumental in its formation in Australia. He constantly avails himself\nto the <acronym title="Aust."><span class="caps">AISSG</span></acronym> and its members. For the past 15 years, Prof. Warne\nhas been advocating full disclosure of the nature of such conditions to\nchildren born with intersex conditions and their parents, despite the fact\nthat other clinicians worldwide still resist such disclosure. It is largely\nthrough the efforts of Prof. Warne that the planned <span class="caps">RCH</span> Bioethics study\nis to take place. A constant throughout discussions between the <acronym title="Aust."><span class="caps">AISSG</span></acronym>\nand Prof. Warne has been his keenness to listen to the personal experiences\nof members and learn from them.
