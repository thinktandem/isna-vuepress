        The <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/aissg/" TARGET="_top">Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia</A> (AISSG(Aust.))  
        is a peer support group providing information and support to people with  
        AIS and their families. Whilst not our primary function, one of the aims  
        of the AISSG(Aust.) is to increase awareness in the general medical community  
        of the personal issues faced by people with AIS.
        
  
  
        The AIS Support Group is opposed to any unnecessary medical intervention  
        when treating any intersex condition. Having said this, the AISSG(Aust.)  
        recognises there is still considerable debate over what constitutes "necessary  
        medical intervention" in such cases. The AISSG(Aust.) also recognises  
        that what was considered by most paediatricians and surgeons as best practice  
        for medical intervention 30 years ago may not be considered by some clinicians  
        to be best practice now. The AISSG(Aust.) is therefore of the opinion that  
        any clinician moving in a positive direction to influence or change best  
        practice to improve the regimes for treatment of children with intersex  
        conditions should be supported.
        
  
  
        Members of the AISSG(Aust.) have been working with the Royal Children's  
        Hospital Melbourne (RCH) in an attempt to assist the identification and  
        implementation of world's best practice for the treatment of children with  
        intersex conditions. Earlier this year, the RCH announced its intention  
        to undertake an extensive bioethics study including 200 follow-up studies  
        of children with intersex conditions who have undergone some level of medical  
        intervention. The intended Bioethics study has formalised arrangements with  
        the AISSG(Aust.) to assist identification of best practice for the medical  
        management of children with intersex conditions. The AISSG(Aust.) hopes  
        that such initiatives that include both clinicians and support groups will  
        be seen by other medical centres world-wide as the only way of ensuring  
        that the needs of patients, their parents and clinicians are met adequately.  
        
        
  
  
        Prof. Garry Warne of the RCH is a keen advocate of the AISSG(Aust.) and  
        was instrumental in its formation in Australia. He constantly avails himself  
        to the AISSG(Aust.) and its members. For the past 15 years, Prof. Warne  
        has been advocating full disclosure of the nature of such conditions to  
        children born with intersex conditions and their parents, despite the fact  
        that other clinicians worldwide still resist such disclosure. It is largely  
        through the efforts of Prof. Warne that the planned RCH Bioethics study  
        is to take place. A constant throughout discussions between the AISSG(Aust.)  
        and Prof. Warne has been his keenness to listen to the personal experiences  
        of members and learn from them.
