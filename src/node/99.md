title: UK pediatric surgeons urge full informed consent including psychological alternative to surgery
---

\nA working group under the British Association of Pediatric Surgeons released a [groundbreaking statement][1] regarding the treatment of children with intersex conditions. Incorporating input from medical consumer groups such as [Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group][2] and Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Network, the report states: &#8220;While there is likely to be continuing pressure from parents for early corrective surgery, fully informed consent for such procedures would require them to be aware of the possibility of non-operative management with psychological support for the child and family.&#8221;\n
