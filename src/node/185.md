<FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Nature</I> reports on estrogen as a male hormone</FONT>  
  


Though scientists know that both estrogen and testosterone play important  
functions in both males and females, the simplistic notion that estrogen  
is "a female hormone" and testosterone "a male hormone" persists.  
  


Scientists at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have reported  
(Nature, 4 December 1997, Hess et al) yet another vital function of estrogen  
in men. Hess and his team found that the testes  
  
in male mice lacking receptors for estrogen quickly degenerate, leaving  
the mice sterile. The effect  
  
appears to be due to a failure of the&nbsp; efferent tubes which normally  
transport immature sperm to the epidydimis, where the sperm mature.  
  


"Suddenly, the idea of 'male' and 'female' hormones begins to look thin,"  
noted Hess's colleague  
  
Kenneth Korach.
