<FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Nature</I> reports on estrogen as a male hormone</FONT><br><br>

Though scientists know that both estrogen and testosterone play important<br>functions in both males and females, the simplistic notion that estrogen<br>is &#8220;a female hormone&#8221; and testosterone &#8220;a male hormone&#8221; persists.<br><br>

Scientists at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have reported<br>(Nature, 4 December 1997, Hess et al) yet another vital function of estrogen<br>in men. Hess and his team found that the testes<br>  
in male mice lacking receptors for estrogen quickly degenerate, leaving<br>the mice sterile. The effect<br>  
appears to be due to a failure of the&nbsp; efferent tubes which normally<br>transport immature sperm to the epidydimis, where the sperm mature.<br><br>

&#8220;Suddenly, the idea of &#8216;male&#8217; and &#8216;female&#8217; hormones begins to look thin,&#8221;<br>noted Hess&#8217;s colleague<br>
