<BR />\n<B>John/Joan redux in<I> Pediatrics</I></B></P>\n\n

<P>
  A new article in the Electronic Pages of the journal <I>Pediatrics</I>\npresents a second case of a Canadian infant whose penis was accidentally\ndestroyed during circumcision, and whom doctors "reassigned as a female"\nby removing his testes. In contrast to "John/Joan", whose case\nwas widely reported last year, this individual is reported to have developed\na female gender identity, though rather atypical.

<P>
  The report received widespread attention in the popular press. <BR />\n
  
  <P>
    Because these cases have been used as "evidence" about whether\nor not children with ambiguous genitals can successfully be assigned and\nraised as either sex (as asserted by, for example, <BR />\nthe American Academy of Pediatrics), we would like to present a sampling\nof comments on the article by intersex people, many of whom were subjected\nto surgeries motivated by interpretations of cases like "John/Joan."

    Max Beck (Re: Experiment of Nurture): <BR />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for the fascinating (if disturbing) <span class="caps">URL</span>.\nI tend to avoid things medical and academic, particularly those bearing\nthe label "pediatric," simply to spare myself the inevitable pain.\n(Call me an <BR />\n&nbsp;ostrich&#8230;) The mention of J/J caught my attention, however, since&nbsp;\nDiamond and Sigmundson&#8217;s work &#8211; and, more importantly, John&#8217;s courage&nbsp;\n- have played a key role in my moving away from pain and into healing.
  </P>\n\n
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find it interesting that the authors of this\nstudy do not&nbsp; investigate the possible effects of "negative nurture"\n- or reverse&nbsp; psychology &#8211; which seem to leap right off the page: While\nJohn had a <BR />\n&nbsp;well-adjusted male twin and a supportive, loving father, Bradley&#8217;s&nbsp;\npatient had an alcoholic father who left when she was 3-4, in part "because\nof the father having had a greater difficulty than the mother&nbsp; in dealing\nwith the &#8216;loss&#8217; [With what arrogance do the authors suggest&nbsp; a loss\n*hasn&#8217;t* occurred?!!] of his son," followed by an alcoholic stepfather.\nNo wonder she "denied ever feeling that she had wanted to be a male"!
  </P>\n\n
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, however, I find the positive\nslant given the patient&#8217;s desire for further corrective surgery naive and\nmisguided, and I can only agree with Lee&#8217;s comments re. time and healing:\nAt 26, I was &#8211; ostensibly &#8211; happily, heterosexually married to a man; had\na <BR />\n&nbsp;team of doctors shown up to ask me how I was, that is most certainly&nbsp;\nwhat I would have told them. 2 years later, at 28, I was divorced, and pursuing\nfurther corrective surgery to normalize my genitalia <BR />\n&nbsp;(specifically, to reduce or remove a "palpable, thick cord of\nerectile tissue running from the glans," which, I "specifically\ncomplained," became quite engorged "with sexual arousal")\n- a normalizing surgery I&nbsp; requested because previous experience had\nshown me that while male <BR />\n&nbsp;partners rarely offered commentary, my desired partners &#8211; females\n- inevitably did, i.e., I wanted to be more "normal" so I could\nbe comfortably "deviant"!
  </P>\n\n
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 years later, I am infinitely thankful that\nan accepting and appreciative lover appeared on the horizon mere weeks before\nthe scheduled surgery, which I immediately cancelled. I have been living\n<BR />\n&nbsp;as a male (and on the Big T) since March of 1998, and had I proceeded&nbsp;\nwith surgery, where would my wonderfully engorged phalloclit &#8211; more than\ndouble its pre-testosterone size &#8211; be today?!&nbsp; It is <strong>so</strong> very important\nto move away from these snapshot case histories toward a&nbsp; bigger picture!\nThink of the damage this study might do if it had been published just a\nfew years ago, with the patient (valiantly, one supposes&#8230;) still struggling\nto "right" her body for heterosexual <BR />\n&nbsp;romance&#8230;

    Lee Brown (Re: Experiment of Nurture):
  </P>\n\n
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;I think the paper is a reasonably transparent attempt to challenge\nthe Diamond&#8217;s findings of the J/J case.&nbsp; Showing that the Money paradigm\nhas some validity in this person&#8217;s case takes away some of the &#8216;blame/guilt&#8217;\nwhich can be targeted at psychologists and other specialists involved in\nintersexual medicine.&nbsp; It does this by re-enstating the necessity of\nvery early intervention (7 months&nbsp; against 17-21 months for J/J (p.4.l)\nand echoing the old demon &#8216;parential ambivalence&#8217; (p2r;3l).&nbsp; This is\nwhat gets me most about the paper &#8212; the person is presented as a showpiece.&nbsp;\nAt least in Diamond&#8217;s work we do get to hear a lot from John (something\nwhich is very uncommon in any of the sexology literature it seems).
  </P>\n\n
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;I agree with all the points which Heike says are problems with\nthe paper &#8230; I would add however some of my general concerns. First intersexuals\nare trained to be good patients and to say what the <BR />\n&nbsp;&#8216;white-coats&#8217; want to hear.&nbsp; There are some rebels in the ranks\nbut many (including myself) seem to <BR />\n&nbsp;internalise those doubts and feelings while they continue to play\nthe good patient (at least I did then &#8212; I tend to be a slow learner, even\nof&nbsp; rebellion ;<del>) ).</P>\n\n
    
    
  <P>
        &nbsp;My second problem is the question of age.&nbsp; I know that at\n26 I was still busy trying to deny my pain and gender confusion to myself\n&#8212; acknowledge it or finally find &#8216;names&#8217; for it rather than wonder is <BR />\n&nbsp;this what life is?&nbsp; &#8212; my breakdown / burst-through was still\nsome years off.
      </P>
\n\n
    
    
  <P>
        &nbsp;My third point is that the paper seems to suggest very little hospitalisation\n(although whether that&#8217;s the case or not is impossible to tell) whereas\nmedical intervention in the J/J case, if the Rolling <BR />\n&nbsp;Stone article was correct, was Analoguous to Childhood Sexual Abuse\n(to borrow the title of (<A HREF="/articles/analog">Tamara Alexander&#8217;s paper</A>)).
      </P>
\n\n
    
    
  <P>
        &nbsp;<span class="caps">BTW</span> This is also my difficulty with Diamond&#8217;s paper on the case\n&#8212; what is read as the rejection of being regendered could also be the rejection\nof a traumatic situation vis a vis &#8216;being intimately <BR />\n&nbsp;studied.&#8217;&nbsp; I do know that in my case the trauma of being regendered\nby the "caring professions" locked me out of myself for many years\n(see above).
      </P>
\n\n
    
    
  <P>
        &nbsp;It is actually very interesting to note that Slijper et.al., ["Long-Term\nPsychological Evaluation of Intersex Children", <strong>Archives of Sexual\nBehavior</strong> 27(2):125-144, 1998] mention in passing that <BR />\n&nbsp;hospitalisation can be a traumatic experience for children but do\nnot follow it up at all.&nbsp; They, like the papers mentioned above, remained\nfocused on the question of gender identity order/disorder rather than questions\nof personal bodily integrity and violation.
      </P>
\n\n
    
    
  <P>
        &nbsp;In a sense I don&#8217;t think the paper is a study of the question of\ngender identity, rather it is interesting to read it as study of the politics\nof sexology. <BR />\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;
      </P>

        Heike Boedeker (a world w/out love): <BR />\n&nbsp;the focus on "fuckability" is something I always experienced\nas abysmally awful, and, indeed, a form of extreme violence. I experienced\nit as an "aversion therapy" that, despite my obvious sexual curiosity\nand several crushes I had on males (as well as females, I&#8217;m not the type\nto miss too many things :</del>)) in my teens, <strong>forced</strong> me to pursue an asexual\nlifestlye until my mid 20s, as I just <BR />\n&nbsp;couldn&#8217;t allow the last remnants of my personal integrity to be destructed.\nThe pathetic irony being that if I could have felt loved this had been the\nform of sexuality that I had wanted (I know I&#8217;m <BR />\n&nbsp;boring :<del>)). But a world in which my bodly integrity constantly was\nat&nbsp; stake, and in which my genitals were something people took upon\nthemselves to exploit, was a world w/out love. And everyone who had told\nme something different I only could have called a liar :-(( <BR />\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</P>\n\n
        
        
  <P>
            Jeannine Howe (Re: a world w/ out love): <BR />\n&nbsp;Sorry Hon I couldn&#8217;t get through the article. The abstract made me&nbsp;\nwant to puke. It was patently obvious <span class="caps">IMNSHO</span> that they don&#8217;t know enough\nto fucking go cutting on babies and if they want to slice off a dick they\nshould begin with the one that belongs to them. <BR />\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;

            Kiira Triea (Babes in Genderland): <BR />\n&nbsp;It&#8217;s funny how one&#8217;s perspective on these surgical issues changes\neh? I think over the past five years I&#8217;ve gone from near suicide over my\nsurgical results to "Since I was treated like crap at the <span class="caps">PRU</span> I think\nit is appropriate that my genitals <strong>look</strong> like crap. I&#8217;m <strong>proud</strong> of my crappy\nlooking genitals!" In fact during those episodes of Naivety Psychosis\nwhen I sought help from Hopkins they tried to convince me that they could\n_improve_ upon Jones&#8217; 1974 efforts&#8230; in essence I think trying to buy my\navailability again. Thankfully, my fear protected me. <sigh>
          </P>
\n\n
        
        
  <P>
            &nbsp;It&#8217;s also interesting how we differ in our preconceptions and experiences\nwith partners. I never even attempted sex with men or women for fear of\nbeing "discovered" and also shame of my body and <BR />\n&nbsp;history. But when I acquired a sense of sexuality I imagined myself\nfirst to be heterosexual because of the nature of my sexuality, then bisexual\nand finally "empirical lesbian" seemed to fit best. This was <BR />\n&nbsp;at age 32 &#8230; I knew <strong>nothing</strong> of any of this at age 26! Yes.. if\nthe "white-coats" had asked me did I want sex with men I would\nhave answered yes. But I believe very strongly that tied up in my ability\n<BR />\n&nbsp;to be sexual with women and not men is simply the belief that women\nwere less likely to hurt me over my "difference". I am not surprised\nconsidering that my father abandoned me, my stepfather abused me verbally\nand physically after surgery and most of the trauma incurred at Hopkins\nwas inflicted by men. Am I likely to expose my innermost emotional and physical\nself under these circumstances?
          </P>

  <P>
            &nbsp;What pisses me off is that we ourselves try to believe this stuff\n</del> then when it all crashes we have no one to turn to. We have each other\nbut I&#8217;m betting this kid has no one. <BR />\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;

            Martha Coventry (<span class="caps">URL</span>?): <BR />\n&nbsp;I, like Max, am tired of snapshot cases and endless words and paper\nbeing spilled out in overanalyzing one case. I hate the practice of the\nmedical/academic world of extrapolating theories and whole treatment paradigms\nfrom one or two or even a handful of cases. Look what that practice did\nto the clits of America starting in the 50s!! Anyway. I appreciated your\ncomments, Max, and will read them again after I read the entire piece. They\nmade me think of my own body and <BR />\n&nbsp;what I did to be a woman who could finally be fucked by a man &#8212; only\nto see my desire for women find its natural course less than a year later.\nAh, lucky there is self-forgiveness in the world&#8230;. (sigh and smile). <BR />\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;
