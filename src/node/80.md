<BR /><br /><B>John/Joan redux in<I> Pediatrics</I></B></P><br /><br />

<P>
  A new article in the Electronic Pages of the journal <I>Pediatrics</I><br />presents a second case of a Canadian infant whose penis was accidentally<br />destroyed during circumcision, and whom doctors "reassigned as a female"<br />by removing his testes. In contrast to "John/Joan", whose case<br />was widely reported last year, this individual is reported to have developed<br />a female gender identity, though rather atypical.

  The report received widespread attention in the popular press. <BR /><br />
  
  <P>
    Because these cases have been used as "evidence" about whether<br />or not children with ambiguous genitals can successfully be assigned and<br />raised as either sex (as asserted by, for example, <BR /><br />the American Academy of Pediatrics), we would like to present a sampling<br />of comments on the article by intersex people, many of whom were subjected<br />to surgeries motivated by interpretations of cases like "John/Joan."

    Max Beck (Re: Experiment of Nurture): <BR /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for the fascinating (if disturbing) URL.<br />I tend to avoid things medical and academic, particularly those bearing<br />the label "pediatric," simply to spare myself the inevitable pain.<br />(Call me an <BR /><br />&nbsp;ostrich...) The mention of J/J caught my attention, however, since&nbsp;<br />Diamond and Sigmundson's work - and, more importantly, John's courage&nbsp;<br />- have played a key role in my moving away from pain and into healing.
  </P>
  
  <br /><br />
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find it interesting that the authors of this<br />study do not&nbsp; investigate the possible effects of "negative nurture"<br />- or reverse&nbsp; psychology - which seem to leap right off the page: While<br />John had a <BR /><br />&nbsp;well-adjusted male twin and a supportive, loving father, Bradley's&nbsp;<br />patient had an alcoholic father who left when she was 3-4, in part "because<br />of the father having had a greater difficulty than the mother&nbsp; in dealing<br />with the 'loss' [With what arrogance do the authors suggest&nbsp; a loss<br />*hasn't* occurred?!!] of his son," followed by an alcoholic stepfather.<br />No wonder she "denied ever feeling that she had wanted to be a male"!
  </P>
  
  <br /><br />
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, however, I find the positive<br />slant given the patient's desire for further corrective surgery naive and<br />misguided, and I can only agree with Lee's comments re. time and healing:<br />At 26, I was - ostensibly - happily, heterosexually married to a man; had<br />a <BR /><br />&nbsp;team of doctors shown up to ask me how I was, that is most certainly&nbsp;<br />what I would have told them. 2 years later, at 28, I was divorced, and pursuing<br />further corrective surgery to normalize my genitalia <BR /><br />&nbsp;(specifically, to reduce or remove a "palpable, thick cord of<br />erectile tissue running from the glans," which, I "specifically<br />complained," became quite engorged "with sexual arousal")<br />- a normalizing surgery I&nbsp; requested because previous experience had<br />shown me that while male <BR /><br />&nbsp;partners rarely offered commentary, my desired partners - females<br />- inevitably did, i.e., I wanted to be more "normal" so I could<br />be comfortably "deviant"!
  </P>
  
  <br /><br />
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 years later, I am infinitely thankful that<br />an accepting and appreciative lover appeared on the horizon mere weeks before<br />the scheduled surgery, which I immediately cancelled. I have been living<br /><BR /><br />&nbsp;as a male (and on the Big T) since March of 1998, and had I proceeded&nbsp;<br />with surgery, where would my wonderfully engorged phalloclit - more than<br />double its pre-testosterone size - be today?!&nbsp; It is *so* very important<br />to move away from these snapshot case histories toward a&nbsp; bigger picture!<br />Think of the damage this study might do if it had been published just a<br />few years ago, with the patient (valiantly, one supposes...) still struggling<br />to "right" her body for heterosexual <BR /><br />&nbsp;romance...

    &nbsp;I think the paper is a reasonably transparent attempt to challenge<br />the Diamond's findings of the J/J case.&nbsp; Showing that the Money paradigm<br />has some validity in this person's case takes away some of the 'blame/guilt'<br />which can be targeted at psychologists and other specialists involved in<br />intersexual medicine.&nbsp; It does this by re-enstating the necessity of<br />very early intervention (7 months&nbsp; against 17-21 months for J/J (p.4.l)<br />and echoing the old demon 'parential ambivalence' (p2r;3l).&nbsp; This is<br />what gets me most about the paper -- the person is presented as a showpiece.&nbsp;<br />At least in Diamond's work we do get to hear a lot from John (something<br />which is very uncommon in any of the sexology literature it seems).
  </P>
  
  <br /><br />
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;I agree with all the points which Heike says are problems with<br />the paper ... I would add however some of my general concerns. First intersexuals<br />are trained to be good patients and to say what the <BR /><br />&nbsp;'white-coats' want to hear.&nbsp; There are some rebels in the ranks<br />but many (including myself) seem to <BR /><br />&nbsp;internalise those doubts and feelings while they continue to play<br />the good patient (at least I did then -- I tend to be a slow learner, even<br />of&nbsp; rebellion ;-) ).
  </P>
  
  <br /><br />
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;My second problem is the question of age.&nbsp; I know that at<br />26 I was still busy trying to deny my pain and gender confusion to myself<br />-- acknowledge it or finally find 'names' for it rather than wonder is <BR /><br />&nbsp;this what life is?&nbsp; -- my breakdown / burst-through was still<br />some years off.
  </P>
  
  <br /><br />
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;My third point is that the paper seems to suggest very little hospitalisation<br />(although whether that's the case or not is impossible to tell) whereas<br />medical intervention in the J/J case, if the Rolling <BR /><br />&nbsp;Stone article was correct, was Analoguous to Childhood Sexual Abuse<br />(to borrow the title of (<A HREF="/articles/analog">Tamara Alexander's paper</A>)).
  </P>
  
  <br /><br />
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;BTW This is also my difficulty with Diamond's paper on the case<br />-- what is read as the rejection of being regendered could also be the rejection<br />of a traumatic situation vis a vis 'being intimately <BR /><br />&nbsp;studied.'&nbsp; I do know that in my case the trauma of being regendered<br />by the "caring professions" locked me out of myself for many years<br />(see above).
  </P>
  
  <br /><br />
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;It is actually very interesting to note that Slijper et.al., ["Long-Term<br />Psychological Evaluation of Intersex Children", *Archives of Sexual<br />Behavior* 27(2):125-144, 1998] mention in passing that <BR /><br />&nbsp;hospitalisation can be a traumatic experience for children but do<br />not follow it up at all.&nbsp; They, like the papers mentioned above, remained<br />focused on the question of gender identity order/disorder rather than questions<br />of personal bodily integrity and violation.
  </P>
  
  <br /><br />
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;In a sense I don't think the paper is a study of the question of<br />gender identity, rather it is interesting to read it as study of the politics<br />of sexology. <BR /><br />------
  </P>
  
  <br /><br />
  
  <P>
    Heike Boedeker (a world w/out love): <BR /><br />&nbsp;the focus on "fuckability" is something I always experienced<br />as abysmally awful, and, indeed, a form of extreme violence. I experienced<br />it as an "aversion therapy" that, despite my obvious sexual curiosity<br />and several crushes I had on males (as well as females, I'm not the type<br />to miss too many things :-)) in my teens, *forced* me to pursue an asexual<br />lifestlye until my mid 20s, as I just <BR /><br />&nbsp;couldn't allow the last remnants of my personal integrity to be destructed.<br />The pathetic irony being that if I could have felt loved this had been the<br />form of sexuality that I had wanted (I know I'm <BR /><br />&nbsp;boring :-)). But a world in which my bodly integrity constantly was<br />at&nbsp; stake, and in which my genitals were something people took upon<br />themselves to exploit, was a world w/out love. And everyone who had told<br />me something different I only could have called a liar :-(( <BR /><br />------

    Jeannine Howe (Re: a world w/ out love): <BR /><br />&nbsp;Sorry Hon I couldn't get through the article. The abstract made me&nbsp;<br />want to puke. It was patently obvious IMNSHO that they don't know enough<br />to fucking go cutting on babies and if they want to slice off a dick they<br />should begin with the one that belongs to them. <BR /><br />------
  </P>
  
  <br /><br />
  
  <P>
    Kiira Triea (Babes in Genderland): <BR /><br />&nbsp;It's funny how one's perspective on these surgical issues changes<br />eh? I think over the past five years I've gone from near suicide over my<br />surgical results to "Since I was treated like crap at the PRU I think<br />it is appropriate that my genitals *look* like crap. I'm *proud* of my crappy<br />looking genitals!" In fact during those episodes of Naivety Psychosis<br />when I sought help from Hopkins they tried to convince me that they could<br />_improve_ upon Jones' 1974 efforts... in essence I think trying to buy my<br />availability again. Thankfully, my fear protected me. <sigh>
  </P>
  
  <br /><br />
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;It's also interesting how we differ in our preconceptions and experiences<br />with partners. I never even attempted sex with men or women for fear of<br />being "discovered" and also shame of my body and <BR /><br />&nbsp;history. But when I acquired a sense of sexuality I imagined myself<br />first to be heterosexual because of the nature of my sexuality, then bisexual<br />and finally "empirical lesbian" seemed to fit best. This was <BR /><br />&nbsp;at age 32 ... I knew *nothing* of any of this at age 26! Yes.. if<br />the "white-coats" had asked me did I want sex with men I would<br />have answered yes. But I believe very strongly that tied up in my ability<br /><BR /><br />&nbsp;to be sexual with women and not men is simply the belief that women<br />were less likely to hurt me over my "difference". I am not surprised<br />considering that my father abandoned me, my stepfather abused me verbally<br />and physically after surgery and most of the trauma incurred at Hopkins<br />was inflicted by men. Am I likely to expose my innermost emotional and physical<br />self under these circumstances?
  </P>
  
  <br /><br />
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;What pisses me off is that we ourselves try to believe this stuff<br />- then when it all crashes we have no one to turn to. We have each other<br />but I'm betting this kid has no one. <BR /><br />------

    Martha Coventry (URL?): <BR /><br />&nbsp;I, like Max, am tired of snapshot cases and endless words and paper<br />being spilled out in overanalyzing one case. I hate the practice of the<br />medical/academic world of extrapolating theories and whole treatment paradigms<br />from one or two or even a handful of cases. Look what that practice did<br />to the clits of America starting in the 50s!! Anyway. I appreciated your<br />comments, Max, and will read them again after I read the entire piece. They<br />made me think of my own body and <BR /><br />&nbsp;what I did to be a woman who could finally be fucked by a man -- only<br />to see my desire for women find its natural course less than a year later.<br />Ah, lucky there is self-forgiveness in the world.... (sigh and smile). <BR /><br />------
