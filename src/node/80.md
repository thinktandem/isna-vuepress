<BR /><br><B>John/Joan redux in<I> Pediatrics</I></B></P><br><br>

<P>
  A new article in the Electronic Pages of the journal <I>Pediatrics</I><br>presents a second case of a Canadian infant whose penis was accidentally<br>destroyed during circumcision, and whom doctors "reassigned as a female"<br>by removing his testes. In contrast to "John/Joan", whose case<br>was widely reported last year, this individual is reported to have developed<br>a female gender identity, though rather atypical.

Zucker. 1998.&nbsp; Experiment of Nurture: Ablatio Penis at 2 Months,<br>Sex Reassignment at 7 Months, and a Psychosexual Follow-up in Young Adulthood.<br>Pediatrics (Electronic Pages) 102 (1):E9. <BR /><br><A HREF="http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/102/1/e9">http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/102/1/e9</A>

<P>
  The report received widespread attention in the popular press. <BR /><br>
  
  <P>
    Because these cases have been used as "evidence" about whether<br>or not children with ambiguous genitals can successfully be assigned and<br>raised as either sex (as asserted by, for example, <BR /><br>the American Academy of Pediatrics), we would like to present a sampling<br>of comments on the article by intersex people, many of whom were subjected<br>to surgeries motivated by interpretations of cases like "John/Joan."

    Max Beck (Re: Experiment of Nurture): <BR /><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for the fascinating (if disturbing) <span class="caps">URL</span>.<br>I tend to avoid things medical and academic, particularly those bearing<br>the label "pediatric," simply to spare myself the inevitable pain.<br>(Call me an <BR /><br>&nbsp;ostrich&#8230;) The mention of J/J caught my attention, however, since&nbsp;<br>Diamond and Sigmundson&#8217;s work &#8211; and, more importantly, John&#8217;s courage&nbsp;<br>- have played a key role in my moving away from pain and into healing.
  </P><br><br>
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find it interesting that the authors of this<br>study do not&nbsp; investigate the possible effects of "negative nurture"<br>- or reverse&nbsp; psychology &#8211; which seem to leap right off the page: While<br>John had a <BR /><br>&nbsp;well-adjusted male twin and a supportive, loving father, Bradley&#8217;s&nbsp;<br>patient had an alcoholic father who left when she was 3-4, in part "because<br>of the father having had a greater difficulty than the mother&nbsp; in dealing<br>with the &#8216;loss&#8217; [With what arrogance do the authors suggest&nbsp; a loss<br>*hasn&#8217;t* occurred?!!] of his son," followed by an alcoholic stepfather.<br>No wonder she "denied ever feeling that she had wanted to be a male"!
  </P><br><br>
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, however, I find the positive<br>slant given the patient&#8217;s desire for further corrective surgery naive and<br>misguided, and I can only agree with Lee&#8217;s comments re. time and healing:<br>At 26, I was &#8211; ostensibly &#8211; happily, heterosexually married to a man; had<br>a <BR /><br>&nbsp;team of doctors shown up to ask me how I was, that is most certainly&nbsp;<br>what I would have told them. 2 years later, at 28, I was divorced, and pursuing<br>further corrective surgery to normalize my genitalia <BR /><br>&nbsp;(specifically, to reduce or remove a "palpable, thick cord of<br>erectile tissue running from the glans," which, I "specifically<br>complained," became quite engorged "with sexual arousal")<br>- a normalizing surgery I&nbsp; requested because previous experience had<br>shown me that while male <BR /><br>&nbsp;partners rarely offered commentary, my desired partners &#8211; females<br>- inevitably did, i.e., I wanted to be more "normal" so I could<br>be comfortably "deviant"!
  </P><br><br>
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 years later, I am infinitely thankful that<br>an accepting and appreciative lover appeared on the horizon mere weeks before<br>the scheduled surgery, which I immediately cancelled. I have been living<br><BR /><br>&nbsp;as a male (and on the Big T) since March of 1998, and had I proceeded&nbsp;<br>with surgery, where would my wonderfully engorged phalloclit &#8211; more than<br>double its pre-testosterone size &#8211; be today?!&nbsp; It is <strong>so</strong> very important<br>to move away from these snapshot case histories toward a&nbsp; bigger picture!<br>Think of the damage this study might do if it had been published just a<br>few years ago, with the patient (valiantly, one supposes&#8230;) still struggling<br>to "right" her body for heterosexual <BR /><br>&nbsp;romance&#8230;

    Lee Brown (Re: Experiment of Nurture):
  </P><br><br>
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;I think the paper is a reasonably transparent attempt to challenge<br>the Diamond&#8217;s findings of the J/J case.&nbsp; Showing that the Money paradigm<br>has some validity in this person&#8217;s case takes away some of the &#8216;blame/guilt&#8217;<br>which can be targeted at psychologists and other specialists involved in<br>intersexual medicine.&nbsp; It does this by re-enstating the necessity of<br>very early intervention (7 months&nbsp; against 17-21 months for J/J (p.4.l)<br>and echoing the old demon &#8216;parential ambivalence&#8217; (p2r;3l).&nbsp; This is<br>what gets me most about the paper &#8212; the person is presented as a showpiece.&nbsp;<br>At least in Diamond&#8217;s work we do get to hear a lot from John (something<br>which is very uncommon in any of the sexology literature it seems).
  </P><br><br>
  
  <P>
    &nbsp;I agree with all the points which Heike says are problems with<br>the paper &#8230; I would add however some of my general concerns. First intersexuals<br>are trained to be good patients and to say what the <BR /><br>&nbsp;&#8216;white-coats&#8217; want to hear.&nbsp; There are some rebels in the ranks<br>but many (including myself) seem to <BR /><br>&nbsp;internalise those doubts and feelings while they continue to play<br>the good patient (at least I did then &#8212; I tend to be a slow learner, even<br>of&nbsp; rebellion ;<del>) ).</P><br><br>
    
    
  <P>
        &nbsp;My second problem is the question of age.&nbsp; I know that at<br>26 I was still busy trying to deny my pain and gender confusion to myself<br>&#8212; acknowledge it or finally find &#8216;names&#8217; for it rather than wonder is <BR /><br>&nbsp;this what life is?&nbsp; &#8212; my breakdown / burst-through was still<br>some years off.
      </P>
<br><br>
    
    
  <P>
        &nbsp;My third point is that the paper seems to suggest very little hospitalisation<br>(although whether that&#8217;s the case or not is impossible to tell) whereas<br>medical intervention in the J/J case, if the Rolling <BR /><br>&nbsp;Stone article was correct, was Analoguous to Childhood Sexual Abuse<br>(to borrow the title of (<A HREF="/articles/analog">Tamara Alexander&#8217;s paper</A>)).
      </P>
<br><br>
    
    
  <P>
        &nbsp;<span class="caps">BTW</span> This is also my difficulty with Diamond&#8217;s paper on the case<br>&#8212; what is read as the rejection of being regendered could also be the rejection<br>of a traumatic situation vis a vis &#8216;being intimately <BR /><br>&nbsp;studied.&#8217;&nbsp; I do know that in my case the trauma of being regendered<br>by the "caring professions" locked me out of myself for many years<br>(see above).
      </P>
<br><br>
    
    
  <P>
        &nbsp;It is actually very interesting to note that Slijper et.al., ["Long-Term<br>Psychological Evaluation of Intersex Children", <strong>Archives of Sexual<br>Behavior</strong> 27(2):125-144, 1998] mention in passing that <BR /><br>&nbsp;hospitalisation can be a traumatic experience for children but do<br>not follow it up at all.&nbsp; They, like the papers mentioned above, remained<br>focused on the question of gender identity order/disorder rather than questions<br>of personal bodily integrity and violation.
      </P>
<br><br>
    
    
  <P>
        &nbsp;In a sense I don&#8217;t think the paper is a study of the question of<br>gender identity, rather it is interesting to read it as study of the politics<br>of sexology. <BR /><br>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;

        Heike Boedeker (a world w/out love): <BR /><br>&nbsp;the focus on "fuckability" is something I always experienced<br>as abysmally awful, and, indeed, a form of extreme violence. I experienced<br>it as an "aversion therapy" that, despite my obvious sexual curiosity<br>and several crushes I had on males (as well as females, I&#8217;m not the type<br>to miss too many things :</del>)) in my teens, <strong>forced</strong> me to pursue an asexual<br>lifestlye until my mid 20s, as I just <BR /><br>&nbsp;couldn&#8217;t allow the last remnants of my personal integrity to be destructed.<br>The pathetic irony being that if I could have felt loved this had been the<br>form of sexuality that I had wanted (I know I&#8217;m <BR /><br>&nbsp;boring :<del>)). But a world in which my bodly integrity constantly was<br>at&nbsp; stake, and in which my genitals were something people took upon<br>themselves to exploit, was a world w/out love. And everyone who had told<br>me something different I only could have called a liar :-(( <BR /><br>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</P><br><br>
        
        
  <P>
            Jeannine Howe (Re: a world w/ out love): <BR /><br>&nbsp;Sorry Hon I couldn&#8217;t get through the article. The abstract made me&nbsp;<br>want to puke. It was patently obvious <span class="caps">IMNSHO</span> that they don&#8217;t know enough<br>to fucking go cutting on babies and if they want to slice off a dick they<br>should begin with the one that belongs to them. <BR /><br>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;

            Kiira Triea (Babes in Genderland): <BR /><br>&nbsp;It&#8217;s funny how one&#8217;s perspective on these surgical issues changes<br>eh? I think over the past five years I&#8217;ve gone from near suicide over my<br>surgical results to "Since I was treated like crap at the <span class="caps">PRU</span> I think<br>it is appropriate that my genitals <strong>look</strong> like crap. I&#8217;m <strong>proud</strong> of my crappy<br>looking genitals!" In fact during those episodes of Naivety Psychosis<br>when I sought help from Hopkins they tried to convince me that they could<br>_improve_ upon Jones&#8217; 1974 efforts&#8230; in essence I think trying to buy my<br>availability again. Thankfully, my fear protected me. <sigh>
          </P>
<br><br>
        
        
  <P>
            &nbsp;It&#8217;s also interesting how we differ in our preconceptions and experiences<br>with partners. I never even attempted sex with men or women for fear of<br>being "discovered" and also shame of my body and <BR /><br>&nbsp;history. But when I acquired a sense of sexuality I imagined myself<br>first to be heterosexual because of the nature of my sexuality, then bisexual<br>and finally "empirical lesbian" seemed to fit best. This was <BR /><br>&nbsp;at age 32 &#8230; I knew <strong>nothing</strong> of any of this at age 26! Yes.. if<br>the "white-coats" had asked me did I want sex with men I would<br>have answered yes. But I believe very strongly that tied up in my ability<br><BR /><br>&nbsp;to be sexual with women and not men is simply the belief that women<br>were less likely to hurt me over my "difference". I am not surprised<br>considering that my father abandoned me, my stepfather abused me verbally<br>and physically after surgery and most of the trauma incurred at Hopkins<br>was inflicted by men. Am I likely to expose my innermost emotional and physical<br>self under these circumstances?

            &nbsp;What pisses me off is that we ourselves try to believe this stuff<br></del> then when it all crashes we have no one to turn to. We have each other<br>but I&#8217;m betting this kid has no one. <BR /><br>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;

            Martha Coventry (<span class="caps">URL</span>?): <BR /><br>&nbsp;I, like Max, am tired of snapshot cases and endless words and paper<br>being spilled out in overanalyzing one case. I hate the practice of the<br>medical/academic world of extrapolating theories and whole treatment paradigms<br>from one or two or even a handful of cases. Look what that practice did<br>to the clits of America starting in the 50s!! Anyway. I appreciated your<br>comments, Max, and will read them again after I read the entire piece. They<br>made me think of my own body and <BR /><br>&nbsp;what I did to be a woman who could finally be fucked by a man &#8212; only<br>to see my desire for women find its natural course less than a year later.<br>Ah, lucky there is self-forgiveness in the world&#8230;. (sigh and smile). <BR /><br>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;
