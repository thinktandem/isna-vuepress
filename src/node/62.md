### May 30, 2003\n <p class=m2><img src="/img/arrow-mini.gif" width=16 height=7 alt="* "> \n Bodies Like Ours Announces Youth Project: Queer\n Bodies</p>\n 

<p class="m2">
  Contact: Betsy Driver 908-832-7755
</p>\n 

<p class="m2">
  Dear Friends,
</p>\n 

<p class="m2">
  Bodies Like Ours is excited to announce the launch\n of our new youth project Queer Bodies.
</p>\n 

<p class="m2">
  Queer Bodies hopes to be a place of understanding and self-directed\n peer support for young, intersex people. While it is web-based\n for the time being, we are sure it will grow into outreach and\n education about intersexuality for young people, by young people\n just like themselves who are proud of whom they are.
</p>\n 

<p class="m2">
  You can find Queer Bodies on the web at http://www.queerbodies.org.
</p>\n 

<p class="m2">
  From the website of Queer Bodies:
</p>\n 

<p class="m2">
  "We&#8217;ve chosen the phrase "queer bodies" to reflect\n that unifying thread of difference. The word "queer" means\n many things &#8212; but it always suggests something unusual, curious,\n or strange. In choosing to embrace "queer" as a description\n of our bodies, we&#8217;re telling the world that while we are different,\n our difference isn&#8217;t reason to be ashamed or to hide ourselves."
</p>\n 

<p class="m2">
  We believe that Queer Bodies is the first initiative ever throughout\n the world that is specifically for young intersexuals. The target\n demographic we hope to reach is from about age 15-25 (although\n everyone is welcome to visit and learn from them!) This historical\n project is being headed by three talented, young intersexuals:
</p>\n 

<p class="m2">
  Asher is queerbodies&#8217; webmaster, activist, geek, and student.\n He became involved with intersex activism through his desire\n to help create community and visibility for people who are often\n isolated from each other. A native computer user and self-identified\n geek, he regards the World Wide Web as an ideal vehicle for activism,\n community, and change. His other pursuits include school (Bellarmine\n University in Louisville), writing, art, and music. Asher resides\n in Kentucky.
</p>\n 

<p class="m2">
  Caitlin is an activist on many fronts; she is passionate about\n animal and human rights. She is a speaker for Bodies Like Ours\n and queerbodies and a contributor to the website. Caitlin lives\n in Georgia.
</p>\n 

<p class="m2">
  Elijah is a self-identified geek. Elijah will be working on\n our message boards, among other contributions to the site. He\n is the newest addition to our tea. Elijah lives in DC.
</p>\n 

<p class="m2">
  As with Bodies Like Ours, one of the many goals of\n Queer Bodies will be to encourage other young people to break\n the chain of\n secrecy and speak up about who they are without shame and secrecy.\n We hope you w&iacute;ll take some time to become acquainted with\n this exciting part of Bodies Like Ours and to learn more about\n what intersex youths are saying.

### May 28, 2003\n <p class=m2><img src="/img/arrow-mini.gif" width=16 height=7 alt="* "> Dr.\n Barron H. Lerner recently published an article in the New York\n Times about intersex issues and the controversy surrounding treatment,\n including the lack of data regarding appropriate care and the\n need for continued research. While Lerner cites recent studies\n showing the harmful effects of surgery, such as the Minto et\n al. study (link 

[here][2]),\n he also quotes Dr. Kenneth Glassberg, who suggests that not performing\n surgery on intersex infants is &#8220;more of an experiment&#8221; than\n surgery itself. The article can be accessed [here][3].</p>\n 

### May 19, 2003\n <p class=m2><img src="/img/arrow-mini.gif" width=16 height=7 alt="* "> An\n important new study has been published by Catherine Minto et\n al, in The Lancet, detailing the long-term impact of clitoral\n surgery. Data show that sexual function could be compromised\n by clitoral surgery; in the study population, many women who\n had been operated on reported sexual difficulties and inability\n to orgasm. The authors argue that debate on the ethics of clitoral\n surgery in children should be promoted and that further research\n is needed on outcome assessment. Parents and patients who consent\n to clitoral surgery should be fully counseled about the potential\n risks to sexual function. The article can be accessed
