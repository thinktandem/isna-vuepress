### May 30, 2003<br> <p class=m2><img src="/img/arrow-mini.gif" width=16 height=7 alt="* "> <br> Bodies Like Ours Announces Youth Project: Queer<br> Bodies</p><br> 

<p class="m2">
  Contact: Betsy Driver 908-832-7755
</p><br> 

<p class="m2">
  Dear Friends,
</p><br> 

<p class="m2">
  Bodies Like Ours is excited to announce the launch<br> of our new youth project Queer Bodies.
</p><br> 

<p class="m2">
  Queer Bodies hopes to be a place of understanding and self-directed<br> peer support for young, intersex people. While it is web-based<br> for the time being, we are sure it will grow into outreach and<br> education about intersexuality for young people, by young people<br> just like themselves who are proud of whom they are.
</p><br> 

<p class="m2">
  You can find Queer Bodies on the web at http://www.queerbodies.org.
</p><br> 

<p class="m2">
  From the website of Queer Bodies:
</p><br> 

<p class="m2">
  "We&#8217;ve chosen the phrase "queer bodies" to reflect<br> that unifying thread of difference. The word "queer" means<br> many things &#8212; but it always suggests something unusual, curious,<br> or strange. In choosing to embrace "queer" as a description<br> of our bodies, we&#8217;re telling the world that while we are different,<br> our difference isn&#8217;t reason to be ashamed or to hide ourselves."
</p><br> 

<p class="m2">
  We believe that Queer Bodies is the first initiative ever throughout<br> the world that is specifically for young intersexuals. The target<br> demographic we hope to reach is from about age 15-25 (although<br> everyone is welcome to visit and learn from them!) This historical<br> project is being headed by three talented, young intersexuals:
</p><br> 

<p class="m2">
  Asher is queerbodies&#8217; webmaster, activist, geek, and student.<br> He became involved with intersex activism through his desire<br> to help create community and visibility for people who are often<br> isolated from each other. A native computer user and self-identified<br> geek, he regards the World Wide Web as an ideal vehicle for activism,<br> community, and change. His other pursuits include school (Bellarmine<br> University in Louisville), writing, art, and music. Asher resides<br> in Kentucky.
</p><br> 

<p class="m2">
  Caitlin is an activist on many fronts; she is passionate about<br> animal and human rights. She is a speaker for Bodies Like Ours<br> and queerbodies and a contributor to the website. Caitlin lives<br> in Georgia.
</p><br> 

<p class="m2">
  Elijah is a self-identified geek. Elijah will be working on<br> our message boards, among other contributions to the site. He<br> is the newest addition to our tea. Elijah lives in DC.
</p><br> 

<p class="m2">
  As with Bodies Like Ours, one of the many goals of<br> Queer Bodies will be to encourage other young people to break<br> the chain of<br> secrecy and speak up about who they are without shame and secrecy.<br> We hope you w&iacute;ll take some time to become acquainted with<br> this exciting part of Bodies Like Ours and to learn more about<br> what intersex youths are saying.

### May 28, 2003<br> <p class=m2><img src="/img/arrow-mini.gif" width=16 height=7 alt="* "> Dr.<br> Barron H. Lerner recently published an article in the New York<br> Times about intersex issues and the controversy surrounding treatment,<br> including the lack of data regarding appropriate care and the<br> need for continued research. While Lerner cites recent studies<br> showing the harmful effects of surgery, such as the Minto et<br> al. study (link 

[here][2]),<br> he also quotes Dr. Kenneth Glassberg, who suggests that not performing<br> surgery on intersex infants is &#8220;more of an experiment&#8221; than<br> surgery itself. The article can be accessed [here][3].</p><br> 

### May 19, 2003<br> <p class=m2><img src="/img/arrow-mini.gif" width=16 height=7 alt="* "> An<br> important new study has been published by Catherine Minto et<br> al, in The Lancet, detailing the long-term impact of clitoral<br> surgery. Data show that sexual function could be compromised<br> by clitoral surgery; in the study population, many women who<br> had been operated on reported sexual difficulties and inability<br> to orgasm. The authors argue that debate on the ethics of clitoral<br> surgery in children should be promoted and that further research<br> is needed on outcome assessment. Parents and patients who consent<br> to clitoral surgery should be fully counseled about the potential<br> risks to sexual function. The article can be accessed 

[here][2].</p><br>
