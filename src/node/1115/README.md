Intersexuella i Sverige (Intersexuals in Sweden)
================================================

Classification: [General Intersex Information/Groups][1]

INIS is a forthcoming organisation for intersex people of Sweden.

Our aim is:

*   to function as a support group for intersexuals and their loved ones;
*   to give accurate information about different medical conditions that cause intersexualism;
*   to influence and change the medical praxis which today mean that children with ambiguous genitals are being withheld information about their medical condition.

INIS strives for ending the shame and the secrecy which surrounds us who are born with ambiguous genitals. It is our hope that we will be a support for each other, and that this site could be a first step to (self)understanding, (self)insight and (self)respect.
