**CHRISTIAN INTERSEX SUPPORT GROUP FORMED**</P>  
  


Intersex Support Group International announces a new ministry based on  
the True Love of Jesus Christ for intersexuals.&nbsp; I.S.G.I. has been  
established from the&nbsp; recognition within mainstream Evangelical Christian  
churches of birth anomalies labeled "Intersex" or "Hermaphrodite".&nbsp;  
Based in Portland, Oregon, U.S.A., the I.S.G.I. grew out of the godly response  
of one Conservative Baptist Church as they studied, prayed, and responded  
with compassion to an adult intersexual within their congregation.&nbsp;  
From the basic discernment that "being born a hermaphrodite is not  
sin", to understanding the complex web of life thrust upon the intersexual,  
I.S.G.I. has blossomed to become an oasis of Christian love and hope.

  
  


For to long, the unyielding demands of people claiming the name of Christ  
have over-ridden the real love and understanding of our Creator and Lord.  
Acknowledged in scriptures, both old and new testaments, persons born with  
ambiguous or non-existent genitalia have been promised special blessing,  
(Isaiah 56:3-5), as well as understanding of their peculiar relationship  
in a two-gendered society, (Matthew19:11-12).

  
  


I.S.G.I. has gathered a highly respected panel of leaders from internationally  
respected ministries, all serving to keep the lines of hope and support  
open to intersexuals, their families, and their church  
  
communities.&nbsp; The 'Manifesto' of I.S.G.I. has been published at the  
group's virtual domain on the world wide web,&nbsp; www.isgi.org

  
  


In addition to the I.S.G.I. web site, a counseling network has been established  
on four continents to provide basic triage' of spiritual and emotional conflicts  
experienced by many who cope with this common life circumstance. (1 in 2000  
births)&nbsp; In cooperation with established intersexual activist groups  
such as ISNA, the Intersex Support Group International has taken the lead  
to provide insight and understanding toward individuals searching for peace  
from their Creator, our Lord Jesus  
  
Christ.

  
  


As intersexuals we have been created unique by God.
