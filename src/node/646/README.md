# Soundprint Radio looks at intersex

<p>[Intersex, a 30 minute radio program produced by Dheera Sujan of Radio Netherlands]<sup class="footnote" id="fnrev14193645705d8ccdd3373a7-1"><a href="#fn14193645705d8ccdd3373a7-1">1</a></sup> is part of Soundprint&#8217;s international documentary exchange series, Crossing Boundaries. Listen online in Real Player format as a group of women with <span class="caps">AIS</span> talk about their lives.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Not telling people about your condition is more difficult than having the condition itself.&#8221;  </p>

<p>&#8220;We appeared on tv as a kind of protest against doctors who are still saying that no one should talk about this. We showed them that we can tell 900,000 people about it, and nothing bad happened to us. In fact, we had nothing but positive reactions.&#8221;  </p>

<p>More info about the program is available from <a href="http://www.rnw.nl/special/en/html/040423vh.html">Radio Netherlands</a> and from <a href="http://www.prx.org/piece_profile.do?id=1541&amp;showAll=true">Public Radio Exchange</a>.</p>
