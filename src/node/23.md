Dear V-Day Participants,  


  
My name is Emi Koyama, and I work for <b class=dr>Intersex Society of  
North America</b> (ISNA). I am also a long-time activist against  
violence against women, and I have volunteered for and worked for  
various organizations that are struggling to stop rape, domestic  
violence, and other forms of violence. Finally, I am the board chair  
for another organization, [  
Survivor Project][2], which addresses the needs of intersex and trans  
survivors of domestic and sexual violence. Like you, I respect and  
appreciate very much how Eve Ensler has helped to re-ignite our  
movement against violence against women through her plays and V-Day  
the organization.  


  
Imagine my disappointment when I went to see the local production of  
_The Vagina Monologues_ on last year's V-Day and witnessed my  
and many other intersex people's experiences of intimate violation  
trivialized and turned into a comical episode - or, to borrow Ensler's  
phrase, "a wonderful vagina fairy tale." The portion in question goes:  
<p class=m4>

  
"One girl in Oklahoma told how she had been born without a vagina, and  
only realized it when she was fourteen. She was playing with her  
girlfriend. They compared their genitals and she realized hers was  
different, something was wrong. She went to the gynecologist with her  
father, the parent she was close to, and the doctor discovered that in  
fact she did not have a vagina or a uterus. Her father was  
heartbroken, trying to repress his tears and sadness, so his daughter  
would not feel bad. On the way home from the doctor, in a noble  
attempt to comfort her, he said, 'Darlin'. We've got an interesting  
situation. You were born without a vagina. But the good news is we're  
gonna get you the best homemade pussy in America. And when you meet  
your husband he's gonna know we had it made specially for him.'" [text  
taken from the V-Day 2002 edition of the script; in the V-Day 2001  
edition book, this is page 99]  
</p>

  
The condition in which vagina is missing or not fully developed is  
called [Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser  
Syndrome][3] (MRKH) or vaginal agenesis. Genetic females (XX) with  
MRKH do not have fully formed vagina, cervix, uterus, and/or fallopian  
tubes. Causes are not known. MRKH and many other conditions that  
result in atypical reproductive and sexual bodies are known collectively  
as intersex, and it is estimated that about one in every 2000 child is  
born with visibly intersex conditions.  


  
Today, the standard treatment for intersex conditions involves  
surgical and hormonal interventions that are designed to alter the  
appearance of the body so that they look more "normal," but do not  
necessarily address any particular health issues. These surgeries  
are often performed when the child is too young to understand or  
consent to what is being done to them, and they are rarely told  
the truth about their medical history even after they grow older.  


  
Even though these surgeries have been performed for the last fifty  
years, there are no long-term studies confirming the effectiveness or  
safety of these procedures; on the contrary, we have found, and recent  
studies have confirmed, that such concealment-centered treatment on  
genitals often result not only in physical scars, but also depression,  
post-traumatic stress response, loss of self-esteem, and, of course,  
loss of sexual sensation.  


  
Many intersex people describe their experiences as a form of child  
sexual abuse, and this is not far from the reality. Like other  
incest survivors, intersex children are physically and sexually  
violated by those we trust the most, those same people who claim to  
have our best interest at heart. Like other incest survivors,  
intersex children are told not to ask questions or tell anyone else  
about our experiences. Like other incest survivors, intersex  
children learn that there are something wrong with who we are, and  
made to feel ashamed and guilty. And, like other incest survivors,  
many intersex people are starting to break the silence and resist  
the erasure of our experiences and the violence that haunt our lives.  


  
In 1993, survivors of these intersex genital mutilation created  
Intersex Society of North America to connect with other intersex  
people and to take back the control over our own bodies. We believe  
that intersex is not something so shameful that it has to be concealed  
medically and socially. We believe that intersex people have the right  
to know all the information currently available about conditions we  
experience, and determine for ourselves what should be done to our  
bodies.  


  
Growing up different is always difficult, but it does not have to be  
as difficult as we have been forced to live. We oppose the idea that  
eliminating our physical differences is the way to address social  
issues we may encounter as a result of being different; rather, we  
believe in addressing social difficulties we may experience through  
social and psychological interventions. Above all, we believe that  
honest communication and the patient-centered medical protocol will  
best serve our needs.  


  
In The Vagina Monologues, the portion quoted above is read as a funny, "wonderful vagina fairy tale"; audience are invited to laugh hysterically to the father's exclamation. In the book (V-Day 2001 edition), Eve Ensler ends this "monologue" with the comment that she was "melted" by the love between the girl and her father. We feel that the play not only misrepresents our experiences as intersex people, but also trivializes our confusion and pain. It also suggests that women's bodies are made solely for their husbands, and that we should alter our bodies to match what is desired by them.  


  
Many of us intersex people and our friends, family members, and allies went to see the play in the past, and came out upset, hurt, angry, and/or in tears, walking through a crowd of women talking to each other about how empowered they felt. We felt invisible, as it presented horror stories about genital mutilations occurring only in other continents, as if we do not experience them here.  


  
However, we felt that it was not wise to "protest" the play or V-Day,  
because they also do many good things: they empower women, raise  
awareness about the violence against women, and contribute  
financially to organizations that fight these violence. Instead of  
staging protests, we decided to use this as an opportunity to raise  
awareness of the experiences of intersex people, and to build greater  
alliances with feminist anti-violence activists everywhere.  


  
We invite you, as individuals and as V-Day organizers, to join our  
movement to end shame, secrecy, and unwanted genital surgeries on  
intersex children, as well as all other violence in the society. Read  
the materials we have on our web site (http://www.isna.org/events/  
vday) and participate in V-Day Challenge 2002, our national initiative  
to make V-Day empowering to all women, including women with intersex  
conditions. There are many things you can do to help us; here are some  
of our suggestions:  


  
1) Print out our handout, and include it as an insert to the program  
at your production of _The Vagina Monologues_, or otherwise make  
it available to everyone who comes to see the play. You can download  
the handout in PDF (one legal-size paper; Adobe Acrobat Reader 4.0 or  
higher needed) at the "Power Tools" section of our web site (<a href=  
"http://www.isna.org/events/vday">http://www.isna.org/events/vday</a>)  
or request a hard copy from us.  


  
2) Download and/or order educational materials about intersex from  
ISNA (see the online store at [  
http://www.isna.org/store/][4]), and use it to educate your campus.  
Write an article about intersex in your newsletter if you have any.  


  
3) Invite us to come and give a presentation about intersex. This  
can be part of V-Day events or at a later date. We have given  
presentations at many college campuses (recent schools include  
Colorado College, Washington State University, Yale University,  
Southern Oregon University, and Humboldt State University).  


  
4) Write a letter to Eve Ensler and V-Day. Express your concern about  
the script and to ask her to consider including more information about  
genital mutilations that happen in the Western societies and damages  
they cause.  


  
5) Have your group endorse a resolution in support of the intersex  
movement. A sample resolution can be found online at <http://www.isna.org/library/resolution.html>  


  
6) Donate a small portion of the proceeds from your V-Day events to  
ISNA and/or Survivor Project.  


  
We do not expect everyone to do all of the above at once (although  
that would be awesome!), but we hope that you will participate in this  
national initiative in one way or the other. If your group decides to  
do any of the above or have any other ideas, we would love to hear  
from you.  


  
V-Day is not just a performance, but a movement - a global movement to  
stop violence against women. As such, it needs to be held politically  
accountable for damages it might inflict, however unintentional that  
may be. I hope that V-Day 2002 will mark the begining of the  
collaborative relationship between us, which will one day end the  
violence against all women and children, including women and children  
who have intersex conditions.  


  
You can read more information about intersex, including "monologues"  
written by women with intersex conditions, at our web site:
