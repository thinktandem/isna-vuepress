<br>January 7, 2002<br>

<br>Dear V-Day Participants, <br>

<br>My name is Emi Koyama, and I work for <b class=dr>Intersex Society of <br>North America</b> (<span class="caps">ISNA</span>). I am also a long-time activist against <br>violence against women, and I have volunteered for and worked for <br>various organizations that are struggling to stop rape, domestic <br>violence, and other forms of violence. Finally, I am the board chair <br>for another organization, [<br>Survivor Project][2], which addresses the needs of intersex and trans <br>survivors of domestic and sexual violence. Like you, I respect and <br>appreciate very much how Eve Ensler has helped to re-ignite our <br>movement against violence against women through her plays and V-Day <br>the organization. <br>

<br>Imagine my disappointment when I went to see the local production of <br>_The Vagina Monologues_ on last year&#8217;s V-Day and witnessed my <br>and many other intersex people&#8217;s experiences of intimate violation <br>trivialized and turned into a comical episode &#8211; or, to borrow Ensler&#8217;s <br>phrase, &#8220;a wonderful vagina fairy tale.&#8221; The portion in question goes:<br><p class=m4><br>&#8220;One girl in Oklahoma told how she had been born without a vagina, and <br>only realized it when she was fourteen. She was playing with her <br>girlfriend. They compared their genitals and she realized hers was <br>different, something was wrong. She went to the gynecologist with her <br>father, the parent she was close to, and the doctor discovered that in <br>fact she did not have a vagina or a uterus. Her father was <br>heartbroken, trying to repress his tears and sadness, so his daughter <br>would not feel bad. On the way home from the doctor, in a noble <br>attempt to comfort her, he said, &#8216;Darlin&#8217;. We&#8217;ve got an interesting <br>situation. You were born without a vagina. But the good news is we&#8217;re <br>gonna get you the best homemade pussy in America. And when you meet <br>your husband he&#8217;s gonna know we had it made specially for him.&#8217;&#8221; [text <br>taken from the V-Day 2002 edition of the script; in the V-Day 2001 <br>edition book, this is page 99] <br></p>

<br>The condition in which vagina is missing or not fully developed is <br>called [Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser <br>Syndrome][3] (<span class="caps">MRKH</span>) or vaginal agenesis. Genetic females (XX) with <br>MRKH do not have fully formed vagina, cervix, uterus, and/or fallopian <br>tubes. Causes are not known. <span class="caps">MRKH</span> and many other conditions that <br>result in atypical reproductive and sexual bodies are known collectively <br>as intersex, and it is estimated that about one in every 2000 child is <br>born with visibly intersex conditions. <br>

<br>Today, the standard treatment for intersex conditions involves <br>surgical and hormonal interventions that are designed to alter the <br>appearance of the body so that they look more &#8220;normal,&#8221; but do not <br>necessarily address any particular health issues. These surgeries <br>are often performed when the child is too young to understand or <br>consent to what is being done to them, and they are rarely told <br>the truth about their medical history even after they grow older. <br>

<br>Even though these surgeries have been performed for the last fifty <br>years, there are no long-term studies confirming the effectiveness or <br>safety of these procedures; on the contrary, we have found, and recent <br>studies have confirmed, that such concealment-centered treatment on <br>genitals often result not only in physical scars, but also depression, <br>post-traumatic stress response, loss of self-esteem, and, of course, <br>loss of sexual sensation. <br>

<br>Many intersex people describe their experiences as a form of child <br>sexual abuse, and this is not far from the reality. Like other <br>incest survivors, intersex children are physically and sexually <br>violated by those we trust the most, those same people who claim to <br>have our best interest at heart. Like other incest survivors, <br>intersex children are told not to ask questions or tell anyone else <br>about our experiences. Like other incest survivors, intersex <br>children learn that there are something wrong with who we are, and <br>made to feel ashamed and guilty. And, like other incest survivors, <br>many intersex people are starting to break the silence and resist <br>the erasure of our experiences and the violence that haunt our lives. <br>

<br>In 1993, survivors of these intersex genital mutilation created <br>Intersex Society of North America to connect with other intersex <br>people and to take back the control over our own bodies. We believe <br>that intersex is not something so shameful that it has to be concealed <br>medically and socially. We believe that intersex people have the right <br>to know all the information currently available about conditions we <br>experience, and determine for ourselves what should be done to our <br>bodies. <br>

<br>Growing up different is always difficult, but it does not have to be <br>as difficult as we have been forced to live. We oppose the idea that <br>eliminating our physical differences is the way to address social <br>issues we may encounter as a result of being different; rather, we <br>believe in addressing social difficulties we may experience through <br>social and psychological interventions. Above all, we believe that <br>honest communication and the patient-centered medical protocol will <br>best serve our needs. <br>

<br>In The Vagina Monologues, the portion quoted above is read as a funny, &#8220;wonderful vagina fairy tale&#8221;; audience are invited to laugh hysterically to the father&#8217;s exclamation. In the book (V-Day 2001 edition), Eve Ensler ends this &#8220;monologue&#8221; with the comment that she was &#8220;melted&#8221; by the love between the girl and her father. We feel that the play not only misrepresents our experiences as intersex people, but also trivializes our confusion and pain. It also suggests that women&#8217;s bodies are made solely for their husbands, and that we should alter our bodies to match what is desired by them. <br>

<br>Many of us intersex people and our friends, family members, and allies went to see the play in the past, and came out upset, hurt, angry, and/or in tears, walking through a crowd of women talking to each other about how empowered they felt. We felt invisible, as it presented horror stories about genital mutilations occurring only in other continents, as if we do not experience them here. <br>

<br>However, we felt that it was not wise to &#8220;protest&#8221; the play or V-Day, <br>because they also do many good things: they empower women, raise <br>awareness about the violence against women, and contribute <br>financially to organizations that fight these violence. Instead of <br>staging protests, we decided to use this as an opportunity to raise <br>awareness of the experiences of intersex people, and to build greater <br>alliances with feminist anti-violence activists everywhere. <br>

<br>We invite you, as individuals and as V-Day organizers, to join our <br>movement to end shame, secrecy, and unwanted genital surgeries on <br>intersex children, as well as all other violence in the society. Read <br>the materials we have on our web site (http://www.isna.org/events/<br>vday) and participate in V-Day Challenge 2002, our national initiative <br>to make V-Day empowering to all women, including women with intersex <br>conditions. There are many things you can do to help us; here are some <br>of our suggestions:<br>

<br>1) Print out our handout, and include it as an insert to the program <br>at your production of _The Vagina Monologues_, or otherwise make <br>it available to everyone who comes to see the play. You can download <br>the handout in <span class="caps">PDF</span> (one legal-size paper; Adobe Acrobat Reader 4.0 or <br>higher needed) at the &#8220;Power Tools&#8221; section of our web site (<a href=<br>"http://www.isna.org/events/vday">http://www.isna.org/events/vday</a>) <br>or request a hard copy from us. <br>

<br>2) Download and/or order educational materials about intersex from <br>ISNA (see the online store at [<br>http://www.isna.org/store/][4]), and use it to educate your campus. <br>Write an article about intersex in your newsletter if you have any. <br>

<br>3) Invite us to come and give a presentation about intersex. This <br>can be part of V-Day events or at a later date. We have given <br>presentations at many college campuses (recent schools include <br>Colorado College, Washington State University, Yale University, <br>Southern Oregon University, and Humboldt State University). <br>

<br>4) Write a letter to Eve Ensler and V-Day. Express your concern about <br>the script and to ask her to consider including more information about <br>genital mutilations that happen in the Western societies and damages <br>they cause. <br>

<br>5) Have your group endorse a resolution in support of the intersex <br>movement. A sample resolution can be found online at <http://www.isna.org/library/resolution.html> <br>

<br>6) Donate a small portion of the proceeds from your V-Day events to <br>ISNA and/or Survivor Project.<br>

<br>We do not expect everyone to do all of the above at once (although <br>that would be awesome!), but we hope that you will participate in this <br>national initiative in one way or the other. If your group decides to <br>do any of the above or have any other ideas, we would love to hear <br>from you. <br>

<br>V-Day is not just a performance, but a movement &#8211; a global movement to <br>stop violence against women. As such, it needs to be held politically <br>accountable for damages it might inflict, however unintentional that <br>may be. I hope that V-Day 2002 will mark the begining of the <br>collaborative relationship between us, which will one day end the <br>violence against all women and children, including women and children <br>who have intersex conditions.<br>

<br>You can read more information about intersex, including &#8220;monologues&#8221; <br>written by women with intersex conditions, at our web site: <br><http://www.isna.org/events/vday> Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.<br>
