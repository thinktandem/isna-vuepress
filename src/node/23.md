\nDear V-Day Participants, \n

\nMy name is Emi Koyama, and I work for <b class=dr>Intersex Society of \nNorth America</b> (<span class="caps">ISNA</span>). I am also a long-time activist against \nviolence against women, and I have volunteered for and worked for \nvarious organizations that are struggling to stop rape, domestic \nviolence, and other forms of violence. Finally, I am the board chair \nfor another organization, [\nSurvivor Project][2], which addresses the needs of intersex and trans \nsurvivors of domestic and sexual violence. Like you, I respect and \nappreciate very much how Eve Ensler has helped to re-ignite our \nmovement against violence against women through her plays and V-Day \nthe organization. \n

\nImagine my disappointment when I went to see the local production of \n_The Vagina Monologues_ on last year&#8217;s V-Day and witnessed my \nand many other intersex people&#8217;s experiences of intimate violation \ntrivialized and turned into a comical episode &#8211; or, to borrow Ensler&#8217;s \nphrase, &#8220;a wonderful vagina fairy tale.&#8221; The portion in question goes:\n<p class=m4>\n&#8220;One girl in Oklahoma told how she had been born without a vagina, and \nonly realized it when she was fourteen. She was playing with her \ngirlfriend. They compared their genitals and she realized hers was \ndifferent, something was wrong. She went to the gynecologist with her \nfather, the parent she was close to, and the doctor discovered that in \nfact she did not have a vagina or a uterus. Her father was \nheartbroken, trying to repress his tears and sadness, so his daughter \nwould not feel bad. On the way home from the doctor, in a noble \nattempt to comfort her, he said, &#8216;Darlin&#8217;. We&#8217;ve got an interesting \nsituation. You were born without a vagina. But the good news is we&#8217;re \ngonna get you the best homemade pussy in America. And when you meet \nyour husband he&#8217;s gonna know we had it made specially for him.&#8217;&#8221; [text \ntaken from the V-Day 2002 edition of the script; in the V-Day 2001 \nedition book, this is page 99] \n</p>

\nThe condition in which vagina is missing or not fully developed is \ncalled [Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser \nSyndrome][3] (<span class="caps">MRKH</span>) or vaginal agenesis. Genetic females (XX) with \nMRKH do not have fully formed vagina, cervix, uterus, and/or fallopian \ntubes. Causes are not known. <span class="caps">MRKH</span> and many other conditions that \nresult in atypical reproductive and sexual bodies are known collectively \nas intersex, and it is estimated that about one in every 2000 child is \nborn with visibly intersex conditions. \n

\nToday, the standard treatment for intersex conditions involves \nsurgical and hormonal interventions that are designed to alter the \nappearance of the body so that they look more &#8220;normal,&#8221; but do not \nnecessarily address any particular health issues. These surgeries \nare often performed when the child is too young to understand or \nconsent to what is being done to them, and they are rarely told \nthe truth about their medical history even after they grow older. \n

\nEven though these surgeries have been performed for the last fifty \nyears, there are no long-term studies confirming the effectiveness or \nsafety of these procedures; on the contrary, we have found, and recent \nstudies have confirmed, that such concealment-centered treatment on \ngenitals often result not only in physical scars, but also depression, \npost-traumatic stress response, loss of self-esteem, and, of course, \nloss of sexual sensation. \n

\nMany intersex people describe their experiences as a form of child \nsexual abuse, and this is not far from the reality. Like other \nincest survivors, intersex children are physically and sexually \nviolated by those we trust the most, those same people who claim to \nhave our best interest at heart. Like other incest survivors, \nintersex children are told not to ask questions or tell anyone else \nabout our experiences. Like other incest survivors, intersex \nchildren learn that there are something wrong with who we are, and \nmade to feel ashamed and guilty. And, like other incest survivors, \nmany intersex people are starting to break the silence and resist \nthe erasure of our experiences and the violence that haunt our lives. \n

\nIn 1993, survivors of these intersex genital mutilation created \nIntersex Society of North America to connect with other intersex \npeople and to take back the control over our own bodies. We believe \nthat intersex is not something so shameful that it has to be concealed \nmedically and socially. We believe that intersex people have the right \nto know all the information currently available about conditions we \nexperience, and determine for ourselves what should be done to our \nbodies. \n

\nGrowing up different is always difficult, but it does not have to be \nas difficult as we have been forced to live. We oppose the idea that \neliminating our physical differences is the way to address social \nissues we may encounter as a result of being different; rather, we \nbelieve in addressing social difficulties we may experience through \nsocial and psychological interventions. Above all, we believe that \nhonest communication and the patient-centered medical protocol will \nbest serve our needs. \n

\nIn The Vagina Monologues, the portion quoted above is read as a funny, &#8220;wonderful vagina fairy tale&#8221;; audience are invited to laugh hysterically to the father&#8217;s exclamation. In the book (V-Day 2001 edition), Eve Ensler ends this &#8220;monologue&#8221; with the comment that she was &#8220;melted&#8221; by the love between the girl and her father. We feel that the play not only misrepresents our experiences as intersex people, but also trivializes our confusion and pain. It also suggests that women&#8217;s bodies are made solely for their husbands, and that we should alter our bodies to match what is desired by them. \n

\nMany of us intersex people and our friends, family members, and allies went to see the play in the past, and came out upset, hurt, angry, and/or in tears, walking through a crowd of women talking to each other about how empowered they felt. We felt invisible, as it presented horror stories about genital mutilations occurring only in other continents, as if we do not experience them here. \n

\nHowever, we felt that it was not wise to &#8220;protest&#8221; the play or V-Day, \nbecause they also do many good things: they empower women, raise \nawareness about the violence against women, and contribute \nfinancially to organizations that fight these violence. Instead of \nstaging protests, we decided to use this as an opportunity to raise \nawareness of the experiences of intersex people, and to build greater \nalliances with feminist anti-violence activists everywhere. \n

\nWe invite you, as individuals and as V-Day organizers, to join our \nmovement to end shame, secrecy, and unwanted genital surgeries on \nintersex children, as well as all other violence in the society. Read \nthe materials we have on our web site (http://www.isna.org/events/\nvday) and participate in V-Day Challenge 2002, our national initiative \nto make V-Day empowering to all women, including women with intersex \nconditions. There are many things you can do to help us; here are some \nof our suggestions:\n

\n1) Print out our handout, and include it as an insert to the program \nat your production of _The Vagina Monologues_, or otherwise make \nit available to everyone who comes to see the play. You can download \nthe handout in <span class="caps">PDF</span> (one legal-size paper; Adobe Acrobat Reader 4.0 or \nhigher needed) at the &#8220;Power Tools&#8221; section of our web site (<a href=\n"http://www.isna.org/events/vday">http://www.isna.org/events/vday</a>) \nor request a hard copy from us. \n

\n2) Download and/or order educational materials about intersex from \nISNA (see the online store at [\nhttp://www.isna.org/store/][4]), and use it to educate your campus. \nWrite an article about intersex in your newsletter if you have any. \n

\n3) Invite us to come and give a presentation about intersex. This \ncan be part of V-Day events or at a later date. We have given \npresentations at many college campuses (recent schools include \nColorado College, Washington State University, Yale University, \nSouthern Oregon University, and Humboldt State University). \n

\n4) Write a letter to Eve Ensler and V-Day. Express your concern about \nthe script and to ask her to consider including more information about \ngenital mutilations that happen in the Western societies and damages \nthey cause. \n

\n5) Have your group endorse a resolution in support of the intersex \nmovement. A sample resolution can be found online at <http://www.isna.org/library/resolution.html> \n

\n6) Donate a small portion of the proceeds from your V-Day events to \nISNA and/or Survivor Project.\n

\nWe do not expect everyone to do all of the above at once (although \nthat would be awesome!), but we hope that you will participate in this \nnational initiative in one way or the other. If your group decides to \ndo any of the above or have any other ideas, we would love to hear \nfrom you. \n

\nV-Day is not just a performance, but a movement &#8211; a global movement to \nstop violence against women. As such, it needs to be held politically \naccountable for damages it might inflict, however unintentional that \nmay be. I hope that V-Day 2002 will mark the begining of the \ncollaborative relationship between us, which will one day end the \nviolence against all women and children, including women and children \nwho have intersex conditions.\n

\nYou can read more information about intersex, including &#8220;monologues&#8221; \nwritten by women with intersex conditions, at our web site: \n<http://www.isna.org/events/vday> Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.\n

\nSincerely,\n
