**Kessler, Suzanne. 1998. Lessons from the Intersexed: Rutgers University<br>Press.**<br><br>

Kessler argues that medical management of intersexuality is guided by<br>cultural beliefs about gender and genitals rather than by the needs of<br>the child.<br><br>

Kessler draws on results from interviews with pediatric surgeons and<br>endocrinologists, parents of intersexed children, and adult intersexuals<br>to propose changes in medical treatment<br>  
of intersexuality. A full chapter, &#8220;Questioning medical management,&#8221;<br>is devoted to the rise of an intersexed patient advocate movement and consideration<br>of its likelihood of success.<br><br>

With 132 pages of text, 31 pages of endnotes, a glossary, 21 pages of<br>bibliographic information, and 14 pages of index, this book is carefully<br>documented, an indispensable addition to the library<br>  
of all who have a personal, scholarly, or social justice interest in<br>the subject.<br><br>
