**Kessler, Suzanne. 1998. Lessons from the Intersexed: Rutgers University\nPress.**\n\n

Kessler argues that medical management of intersexuality is guided by\ncultural beliefs about gender and genitals rather than by the needs of\nthe child.\n\n

Kessler draws on results from interviews with pediatric surgeons and\nendocrinologists, parents of intersexed children, and adult intersexuals\nto propose changes in medical treatment\n  
of intersexuality. A full chapter, &#8220;Questioning medical management,&#8221;\nis devoted to the rise of an intersexed patient advocate movement and consideration\nof its likelihood of success.\n\n

With 132 pages of text, 31 pages of endnotes, a glossary, 21 pages of\nbibliographic information, and 14 pages of index, this book is carefully\ndocumented, an indispensable addition to the library\n  
of all who have a personal, scholarly, or social justice interest in\nthe subject.\n\n
