**Kessler, Suzanne. 1998. Lessons from the Intersexed: Rutgers University  
Press.**  
  


Kessler argues that medical management of intersexuality is guided by  
cultural beliefs about gender and genitals rather than by the needs of  
the child.  
  


Kessler draws on results from interviews with pediatric surgeons and  
endocrinologists, parents of intersexed children, and adult intersexuals  
to propose changes in medical treatment  
  
of intersexuality. A full chapter, "Questioning medical management,"  
is devoted to the rise of an intersexed patient advocate movement and consideration  
of its likelihood of success.  
  


With 132 pages of text, 31 pages of endnotes, a glossary, 21 pages of  
bibliographic information, and 14 pages of index, this book is carefully  
documented, an indispensable addition to the library  
  
of all who have a personal, scholarly, or social justice interest in  
the subject.
