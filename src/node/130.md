### Volunteer to Become a Local Coordinator

  
<p class=m2>  
What does becoming a local coordinator involve? Local/regional coorditors for V-Day Challenge 2002 will be responsible for:  
</p><p class=m4>  
<img src="/img/arrow-mini.gif" width=16 height=7 alt="* ">  
Finding out which schools are putting on _The Vagina Monologues_ in her/his/zir area, and when. (The list of V-Day College Campaign participants is found on [V-Day's web site][8].)  
  
<img src="/img/blank.gif" width=1 height=6 alt="">  
  
<img src="/img/arrow-mini.gif" width=16 height=7 alt="* ">  
Contacting local production crews at these schools, and ask them to [help educate the community][9] about intersex.  
  
<img src="/img/blank.gif" width=1 height=6 alt="">  
  
<img src="/img/arrow-mini.gif" width=16 height=7 alt="* ">  
Distributing [our leaflets][10] at the local productions of _The Vagina Monologues_. You do not have to hit all performances at all schools, but the more the better.  
  
<img src="/img/blank.gif" width=1 height=6 alt="">  
  
<img src="/img/arrow-mini.gif" width=16 height=7 alt="* ">  
Notifying local media (especially alternative, feminist and LGBT media) about the V-Day Challenge 2002 actions. (Read [our FAQ][11] if you are going to be interviewed).  
  
<img src="/img/blank.gif" width=1 height=6 alt="">  
  
<img src="/img/arrow-mini.gif" width=16 height=7 alt="* ">  
Coordinating all the above, and possibly more, by working with other intersex activists and allies in your area.  
  
<img src="/img/blank.gif" width=1 height=6 alt="">  
  
<img src="/img/arrow-mini.gif" width=16 height=7 alt="* ">  
Staying in touch with [Emi][3] from ISNA via email to talk about what is happening locally.  
</p><p class=m2>  
This may seem like a lot of work, but we will help you coordinate it in any way we can! You do not have to take on a large area - for example, you can just take on coordinating the action at one school. If you are interested at all, do [email Emi][3]!  
</p><p class=m2>  
We also would like to hear from you even if you are not ready to become a coordinator but want to help in some other ways. Don't forget to [sign up][2] for ISNA-VD2002 too!
