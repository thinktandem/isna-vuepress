### Volunteer to Become a Local Coordinator\n<p class=m2>\nWhat does becoming a local coordinator involve? Local/regional coorditors for V-Day Challenge 2002 will be responsible for:\n</p><p class=m4>\n<img src="/img/arrow-mini.gif" width=16 height=7 alt="* ">\nFinding out which schools are putting on 

_The Vagina Monologues_ in her/his/zir area, and when. (The list of V-Day College Campaign participants is found on [V-Day&#8217;s web site][8].)\n  
<img src="/img/blank.gif" width=1 height=6 alt="">  
\n<img src="/img/arrow-mini.gif" width=16 height=7 alt="* ">\nContacting local production crews at these schools, and ask them to [help educate the community][9] about intersex.\n  
<img src="/img/blank.gif" width=1 height=6 alt="">  
\n<img src="/img/arrow-mini.gif" width=16 height=7 alt="* ">\nDistributing [our leaflets][10] at the local productions of _The Vagina Monologues_. You do not have to hit all performances at all schools, but the more the better.\n  
<img src="/img/blank.gif" width=1 height=6 alt="">  
\n<img src="/img/arrow-mini.gif" width=16 height=7 alt="* ">\nNotifying local media (especially alternative, feminist and <span class="caps">LGBT</span> media) about the V-Day Challenge 2002 actions. (Read [our <span class="caps">FAQ</span>][11] if you are going to be interviewed).\n  
<img src="/img/blank.gif" width=1 height=6 alt="">  
\n<img src="/img/arrow-mini.gif" width=16 height=7 alt="* ">\nCoordinating all the above, and possibly more, by working with other intersex activists and allies in your area.\n  
<img src="/img/blank.gif" width=1 height=6 alt="">  
\n<img src="/img/arrow-mini.gif" width=16 height=7 alt="* ">\nStaying in touch with [Emi][3] from <span class="caps">ISNA</span> via email to talk about what is happening locally.\n</p><p class=m2>\nThis may seem like a lot of work, but we will help you coordinate it in any way we can! You do not have to take on a large area &#8211; for example, you can just take on coordinating the action at one school. If you are interested at all, do [email Emi][3]!\n</p><p class=m2>\nWe also would like to hear from you even if you are not ready to become a coordinator but want to help in some other ways. Don&#8217;t forget to [sign up][2] for <span class="caps">ISNA</span>-VD2002 too!\n</p>\n
