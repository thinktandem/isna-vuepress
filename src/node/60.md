Reiner, William G. 1997. Sex Assignment in the Neonate with Intersex<br>or Inadequate Genitalia. Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine<br>151:1044-5.<br><br>

Hopkins psychiatrist Reiner (formerly a urologist) offers a &#8220;tentative<br>data-oriented approach.&#8221; In a refreshing departure from the dogmatic assertions<br>of many surgeons in the field (Urology Times 97, Colapinto 97), he recognizes<br>that:<br><br>

o&nbsp; Some XX <span class="caps">CAH</span> individuals &#8220;may be happier in later life as males.&#8221;<br><br>

o&nbsp; Surgical interventions may produce irreversible harm.<br><br>

o&nbsp; &#8220;Surgical reduction of an enlarged clitoris can at times damage<br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sensation and thus reduce orgasmic potential and<br>genital pleasure.&#8221;<br><br>

o&nbsp; &#8220;Sexual orientation may be towards females even if the child<br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is reared as a female&#8221; [micropenis] and &#8220;sexual<br>orientation cannot<br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be reliably predicted in these children at present&#8221;<br>[XX <span class="caps">CAH</span>].<br><br>

We do hope that Reiner will in the future also consider the benefits<br>of peer support for reducing feelings of shame, freakishness, and isolation.<br>
