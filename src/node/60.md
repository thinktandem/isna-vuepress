Reiner, William G. 1997. Sex Assignment in the Neonate with Intersex  
or Inadequate Genitalia. Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine  
151:1044-5.  
  


Hopkins psychiatrist Reiner (formerly a urologist) offers a "tentative  
data-oriented approach." In a refreshing departure from the dogmatic assertions  
of many surgeons in the field (Urology Times 97, Colapinto 97), he recognizes  
that:  
  


o&nbsp; Some XX CAH individuals "may be happier in later life as males."  
  


o&nbsp; Surgical interventions may produce irreversible harm.  
  


o&nbsp; "Surgical reduction of an enlarged clitoris can at times damage  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sensation and thus reduce orgasmic potential and  
genital pleasure."  
  


o&nbsp; "Sexual orientation may be towards females even if the child  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is reared as a female" [micropenis] and "sexual  
orientation cannot  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be reliably predicted in these children at present"  
[XX CAH].  
  


We do hope that Reiner will in the future also consider the benefits  
of peer support for reducing feelings of shame, freakishness, and isolation.
