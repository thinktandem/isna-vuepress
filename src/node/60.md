Reiner, William G. 1997. Sex Assignment in the Neonate with Intersex\nor Inadequate Genitalia. Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine\n151:1044-5.\n\n

Hopkins psychiatrist Reiner (formerly a urologist) offers a &#8220;tentative\ndata-oriented approach.&#8221; In a refreshing departure from the dogmatic assertions\nof many surgeons in the field (Urology Times 97, Colapinto 97), he recognizes\nthat:\n\n

o&nbsp; Some XX <span class="caps">CAH</span> individuals &#8220;may be happier in later life as males.&#8221;\n\n

o&nbsp; Surgical interventions may produce irreversible harm.\n\n

o&nbsp; &#8220;Surgical reduction of an enlarged clitoris can at times damage\n  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sensation and thus reduce orgasmic potential and\ngenital pleasure.&#8221;\n\n

o&nbsp; &#8220;Sexual orientation may be towards females even if the child\n  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is reared as a female&#8221; [micropenis] and &#8220;sexual\norientation cannot\n  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be reliably predicted in these children at present&#8221;\n[XX <span class="caps">CAH</span>].\n\n

We do hope that Reiner will in the future also consider the benefits\nof peer support for reducing feelings of shame, freakishness, and isolation.\n
