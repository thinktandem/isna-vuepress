<FONT SIZE="+1">Discussion of intersex children in <I>Dialogues in Pediatric\nUrology</I></FONT>\n\n

Woodhouse, Christopher R. J. 1997. Quality of Life in Children and Adolescents:\nA Urologist&#8217;s Point of View. _Dialogues in Pediatric Urology_ 20 (11):7-8.\n\n

&#8220;Perhaps the most contentious area at present is the problem of gender\nassignment in intersex infants. The long-held views of urologists and endocrinologists\nare under vigorous attack in the American press and on the Internet. There\nmay be little understanding by laymen of these problems.\n  
There may be no right answer about sex of rearing. There may be better\nsurgical techniques now than 20 years ago. It may seem wrong to send a\nchild with an obvious phallus to a girls school. Nonetheless, if there\nare a significant number of individuals who feel that the childhood surgery\nwas\n  
a mutilation with a poor physical and emotional outcome, there must\nat least be a pause for thought. It is interesting to note that while the\nwestern world tends toward rearing as female in difficult cases, virtually\nall intersex patients in India are raised as male. Is this not an area\nwhere quality of life becomes a paramount consideration?&#8221;\n

Richard Erlich, in his Guest Editor&#8217;s introduction to this issue on\n&#8220;Quality of Life Research in Children: Fashion or Future?&#8221; notes that:\n\n

&#8220;When it comes to quality of life and the psychosocial consequences\nof diseases and abnormalities in pediatric urology, there is a blank in\nthe literature. Some highly specialized urologists have considerable clinical\nexperience in long-term pediatric urology. In scientific terms, however,\nwe\n  
know hardly anything about our patients&#8217; life satisfaction, their self-esteem\nand body image, their coping and social support, their sexuality, and their\nexpectations of us. We do not know the impact of scars, sometimes uncountable\noperations and hospitalizations, the dependency on a catheter, and the\nrestrictions of fluid intake. As a consequence, we do not know how and\nwhen to offer help beyond the scope of urology.&#8221;\n\n

To which we former intersex patients can only say, &#8220;Amen.&#8221;\n
