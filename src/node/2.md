<FONT SIZE="+1">Discussion of intersex children in <I>Dialogues in Pediatric<br>Urology</I></FONT><br><br>

Woodhouse, Christopher R. J. 1997. Quality of Life in Children and Adolescents:<br>A Urologist&#8217;s Point of View. _Dialogues in Pediatric Urology_ 20 (11):7-8.<br><br>

&#8220;Perhaps the most contentious area at present is the problem of gender<br>assignment in intersex infants. The long-held views of urologists and endocrinologists<br>are under vigorous attack in the American press and on the Internet. There<br>may be little understanding by laymen of these problems.<br>  
There may be no right answer about sex of rearing. There may be better<br>surgical techniques now than 20 years ago. It may seem wrong to send a<br>child with an obvious phallus to a girls school. Nonetheless, if there<br>are a significant number of individuals who feel that the childhood surgery<br>was<br>  
a mutilation with a poor physical and emotional outcome, there must<br>at least be a pause for thought. It is interesting to note that while the<br>western world tends toward rearing as female in difficult cases, virtually<br>all intersex patients in India are raised as male. Is this not an area<br>where quality of life becomes a paramount consideration?&#8221;<br>

Richard Erlich, in his Guest Editor&#8217;s introduction to this issue on<br>&#8220;Quality of Life Research in Children: Fashion or Future?&#8221; notes that:<br><br>

&#8220;When it comes to quality of life and the psychosocial consequences<br>of diseases and abnormalities in pediatric urology, there is a blank in<br>the literature. Some highly specialized urologists have considerable clinical<br>experience in long-term pediatric urology. In scientific terms, however,<br>we<br>  
know hardly anything about our patients&#8217; life satisfaction, their self-esteem<br>and body image, their coping and social support, their sexuality, and their<br>expectations of us. We do not know the impact of scars, sometimes uncountable<br>operations and hospitalizations, the dependency on a catheter, and the<br>restrictions of fluid intake. As a consequence, we do not know how and<br>when to offer help beyond the scope of urology.&#8221;<br><br>

To which we former intersex patients can only say, &#8220;Amen.&#8221;<br>
