A Urologist's Point of View. _Dialogues in Pediatric Urology_ 20 (11):7-8.  
  


"Perhaps the most contentious area at present is the problem of gender  
assignment in intersex infants. The long-held views of urologists and endocrinologists  
are under vigorous attack in the American press and on the Internet. There  
may be little understanding by laymen of these problems.  
  
There may be no right answer about sex of rearing. There may be better  
surgical techniques now than 20 years ago. It may seem wrong to send a  
child with an obvious phallus to a girls school. Nonetheless, if there  
are a significant number of individuals who feel that the childhood surgery  
was  
  
a mutilation with a poor physical and emotional outcome, there must  
at least be a pause for thought. It is interesting to note that while the  
western world tends toward rearing as female in difficult cases, virtually  
all intersex patients in India are raised as male. Is this not an area  
where quality of life becomes a paramount consideration?"

Richard Erlich, in his Guest Editor's introduction to this issue on  
"Quality of Life Research in Children: Fashion or Future?" notes that:  
  


"When it comes to quality of life and the psychosocial consequences  
of diseases and abnormalities in pediatric urology, there is a blank in  
the literature. Some highly specialized urologists have considerable clinical  
experience in long-term pediatric urology. In scientific terms, however,  
we  
  
know hardly anything about our patients' life satisfaction, their self-esteem  
and body image, their coping and social support, their sexuality, and their  
expectations of us. We do not know the impact of scars, sometimes uncountable  
operations and hospitalizations, the dependency on a catheter, and the  
restrictions of fluid intake. As a consequence, we do not know how and  
when to offer help beyond the scope of urology."  
  


To which we former intersex patients can only say, "Amen."
