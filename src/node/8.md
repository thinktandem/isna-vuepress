The conference was called &#8220;What&#8217;s All This About Sex? Who, What, When, Where.&#8221; Unfortunately, the midwest docs didn&#8217;t choose to invite any intersex people to speak to them. However, the physicians they invited certainly threw the prevailing model of treatment into doubt. (Here&#8217;s the [meeting agenda][1].) And, three <span class="caps">ISNA</span> members showed up to let physicians know that we have a stake in, and expertise to offer, these discussions.\n
