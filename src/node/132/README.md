_On the Issues_ covers Intersex

The cover story in the current issue of the quarterly glossy magazine  
On The Issues is an account of IGM, or Intersex Genital Mutilation by journalist  
Martha Coventry. Illustrated with photos of Coventry and other survivors  
of the increasingly controversial but still widely imposed operation. A  
sidebar directs readers to several intersex peer support groups.

  
  


"The truth is that the very thing surgery claims to save us from  
-- a sense of differentness and abnormality --it quite unequivocally creates."
