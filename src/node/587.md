# Kicking Assets (a Tides Foundation fund)

[Kicking Assets][1], a donor-directed fund of the Tides Foundation, has supported ISNA's work since 2004. In 2005, Kicking Assets granted us $5,000 to support general operations. Thanks, Kicking Assets!  
  
Why not join them? Every donation helps. ISNA runs mostly on small, individual donations that together can add up to buckets of support. Click here to [donate to support our efforts][2] and to get a copy of our new video, "First Do No Harm: Total Patient Care for Intersex."
