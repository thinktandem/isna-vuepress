<FONT SIZE="+1">Rudolph shot, killed in Michigan</FONT><br><br>

On December 1 of 1996, <span class="caps">ISNA</span> News sent out a news item from a Wisconsin newspaper about a hunter who had shot an intersexed deer. It&#8217;s deer season again, and yet another filler item is running in popular newspapers.<br>

Those of you who don&#8217;t understand what these stories have to do with Rudolph are encouraged to see the story &#8220;Case Report&#8221; in Hermaphrodites with Attitude, at <A HREF="http://www.isna.org/newsletter/winter94-95/winter94-95.html">http://www.isna.org/HWA/Winter94-95/Winter94-95.html</A>.<br>

In the print version of the newsletter, a happy pre-surgery Rudolph was depicted, with bright red nose. The post-surgical Rudolph had a gaping hole where his nose had been removed, and a moving, sorrowful mien. These graphics will be added to the web version eventually.<br>

[Allegan, Mich, 11 Dec 1997]<br>

<span class="caps">WHEN</span> HE <span class="caps">SHOT</span> the deer from 45 yards away, Roy Kaylor could see he&#8217;d bagged something special: an enormous eight-point buck. When he lifted the deer&#8217;s legs, he learned something else entirely.<br>

The he was a she &#8212; a doe with antlers.<br>

Kaylor, 34, who killed the deer with a 12-guage shotgun on Nov 28, met with disbelief when he described his discovery to other hunters.<br>

Kaylor&#8217;s deer weighed 289 pounds.<br><br>
