# Middlesex reviewed in medical journal

Bergman, A. (2004). "Middlesex (Book Review)." _Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine_ 158(5): 500.  
  
"Yes, it is fiction, but I cannot imagine a more authentic and sensitive voice. Because our interactions  
usually take place in limited and structured settings such as offices and hospitals, pediatricians have scant opportunity to learn how our young patients think. One way to sharpen our awareness is to listen to children’s voices as they are expressed in books. In [Middlesex][1], the voice is loud and clear."  
  
The moral of the story is, doctors need to learn to think of people with intersex conditions as people, not conditions or problems.
