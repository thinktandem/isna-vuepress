Again this year, ISNA is pleased and proud to participate in the [Robert Wood Johnson Medical School&#8217;s][1] week-long cross-campus educational opportunity known as &#8220;Sex Week.&#8221; ISNA board member [Debbie Hartman][2] will speak at the opening panel, along with nationally-recognized long-time ISNA ally Janet Green and ISNA&#8217;s former Director of Medical Education, [Alice Dreger][3]. ISNA&#8217;s [Medical Advisory Board][4] member [Nina Williams][5] is helping to organize the event.

  
  


Kudos to the folks at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School for continuing to lead in terms of educating future health care professionals about intersex and other important aspects of human sex, sexuality, and gender!
