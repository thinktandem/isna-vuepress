<span class="caps">WHEREAS</span>, genital surgery has been practiced and encouraged for children<br>born with ambiguous genitalia since the 1950&#8217;s; and<br><br>

<span class="caps">WHEREAS</span>, comprehensive research on the long term effects of intersex<br>surgery has not been done; and<br><br>

<span class="caps">WHEREAS</span>, the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association supports fully informed<br>medical practice backed by solid research and ethical considerations and<br>believes that reports of dissatisfaction with any medical procedure should<br>be examined closely, and<br><br>

<span class="caps">WHEREAS</span>, reports have recently surfaced of adults who are dissatisfied<br>with the surgical interventions performed on them as children, citing both<br>physical and psychological damage; and<br><br>

<span class="caps">WHEREAS</span>, some adults who did not have surgical intervention during childhood<br>are satisfied living without these interventions; therefore be it<br><br>

<span class="caps">RESOLVED</span>: that the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association calls on medical<br>centers involved in surgical intervention for intersex individuals to develop<br>and conduct comprehensive retrospective and prospective research on the<br>long-term physical and psychological effects, successes, and<br>  
failures of surgical intervention on children with ambiguous genitalia;<br>and be it further<br><br>

<span class="caps">RESOLVED</span>:&nbsp; that the development and execution of these studies<br>should involve the input and oversight of community representatives and<br>psychiatrists and other psychological based clinicians involved in the<br>intersex community; and be it further<br><br>

<span class="caps">RESOLVED</span>: that <span class="caps">GLMA</span> encourages all medical providers to counsel parents<br>with full disclosure regarding the possible positive and negative effects<br>of surgical intervention,&nbsp; reported risks, the lack of long-term research<br>associated with surgical intervention, and options including no surgical<br>intervention and peer support groups before recommending any such procedure<br>on a child born with ambiguous genitalia; and be it further<br><br>

<span class="caps">RESOLVED</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; that <span class="caps">GLMA</span> calls on physicians to encourage parents<br>to fully consider various options before making any decision regarding<br>how to proceed.<br>
