Resolution:&nbsp; 105-98-105  
  
Title:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call for Research and Disclosure Regarding  
Intersex Surgery  
  
Author:&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter Sawires  
  
Introduced by: Bob Cabaj, MD  
  
Endorsed by: Policy Committee  
  
Board Approval: March 7, 1998  
  


WHEREAS, genital surgery has been practiced and encouraged for children  
born with ambiguous genitalia since the 1950's; and  
  


WHEREAS, comprehensive research on the long term effects of intersex  
surgery has not been done; and  
  


WHEREAS, the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association supports fully informed  
medical practice backed by solid research and ethical considerations and  
believes that reports of dissatisfaction with any medical procedure should  
be examined closely, and  
  


WHEREAS, reports have recently surfaced of adults who are dissatisfied  
with the surgical interventions performed on them as children, citing both  
physical and psychological damage; and  
  


WHEREAS, some adults who did not have surgical intervention during childhood  
are satisfied living without these interventions; therefore be it  
  


RESOLVED: that the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association calls on medical  
centers involved in surgical intervention for intersex individuals to develop  
and conduct comprehensive retrospective and prospective research on the  
long-term physical and psychological effects, successes, and  
  
failures of surgical intervention on children with ambiguous genitalia;  
and be it further  
  


RESOLVED:&nbsp; that the development and execution of these studies  
should involve the input and oversight of community representatives and  
psychiatrists and other psychological based clinicians involved in the  
intersex community; and be it further  
  


RESOLVED: that GLMA encourages all medical providers to counsel parents  
with full disclosure regarding the possible positive and negative effects  
of surgical intervention,&nbsp; reported risks, the lack of long-term research  
associated with surgical intervention, and options including no surgical  
intervention and peer support groups before recommending any such procedure  
on a child born with ambiguous genitalia; and be it further  
  


RESOLVED:&nbsp;&nbsp; that GLMA calls on physicians to encourage parents  
to fully consider various options before making any decision regarding  
how to proceed.
