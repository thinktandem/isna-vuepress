Classification: [Mosaic Turner's Syndrome][1]

xyTurners hopes to work with parents, patients, physicians, and researchers to promote the health and welfare of genetic mosaic patients and to improve patient-physician relations.

We realize that there is some confusion as to what constitutes Turner's syndrome and that there is some overlap between the various intersex conditions. We are happy to work with clinicians to help clarify these issues. Our goal is not to have XY/XO patients diagnosed as Turner's syndrome; our goal is to have XY/XO patients diagnosed and treated for the medical conditions that are made more likely by their Turner (i.e. XO) mosaicism. The XO cell line that leads to Turner's syndrome, in XY/XO often leads to the same medical conditions that frequently accompany Turner's syndrome.
