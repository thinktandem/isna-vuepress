<br>V-Day, the global movement to stop violence against women and girls,<br>announced today its support for the mission of Intersex Society of<br>North America (<span class="caps">ISNA</span>) to end shame, secrecy and unwanted genital<br>surgeries on intersex children, or children born with atypical<br>reproductive or sexual anatomies. Currently, the standard protocol<br>for treating intersex children involves irreversible and risky<br>surgical interventions to make their genitals appear more &#8220;normal,&#8221;<br>but there is a growing movement among intersex people, allies, and<br>medical professionals to replace these often harmful procedures with<br>social and psychological interventions.<br>

<br>&#8220;We applaud V-Day for taking a stand against unnecessary and<br>unconsentual genital cuttings that are ritually practiced in Western<br>societies, just as they have stood against unnecessary ritualistic<br>genital cuttings in other cultures,&#8221; said Emi Koyama, the Program<br>Assistant for <span class="caps">ISNA</span>. &#8220;I have always respected the work of V-Day on<br>behalf of women and girls, and I am glad to know that V-Day has not<br>left out women and girls born with intersex conditions.&#8221;<br>

<br>As part of its commitment to stop violence against intersex people,<br>V-Day is urging participants of its College Campaign and Worldwide<br>Campaign to raise the awareness about intersex experiences by<br>distributing information about intersex, showing a documentary film,<br>or hosting an intersex speaker during this year&#8217;s V-Day activities<br>along with the performances of Eve Ensler&#8217;s &#8220;The Vagina Monologues&#8221;<br>(materials about intersex are available from <span class="caps">ISNA</span>). V-Day is also<br>encouraging the more than 500 benefit productions of the play to<br>consider contributing a portion of their proceeds to Intersex<br>Society of North America.<br>

<br><b class=dr>About V-Day:</b> V-Day is a global movement that helps anti-violence organizations throughout<br>the world continue and expand their core work on the ground, while drawing public attention to the<br>larger fight to stop worldwide violence (including rape, battery, incest,<br>female genital mutilation (<span class="caps">FGM</span>), sexual slavery) against women and girls.<br>

<br>V-Day is also a day (on or around Valentine&#8217;s Day in February), for which<br>annual theatrical and artistic events are produced around the world to transform consciousness, raise<br>money, and revitalize the spirit of existing anti-violence organizations.<br>Each year, V-Day promotes a series of innovative productions, events and<br>initiatives that are identified collectively as V-Day and the year (i.e.<br>V-Day 2001, V-Day 2002, V-Day 2003&#8230;).<br><br><br>
