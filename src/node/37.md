\nV-Day, the global movement to stop violence against women and girls,\nannounced today its support for the mission of Intersex Society of\nNorth America (<span class="caps">ISNA</span>) to end shame, secrecy and unwanted genital\nsurgeries on intersex children, or children born with atypical\nreproductive or sexual anatomies. Currently, the standard protocol\nfor treating intersex children involves irreversible and risky\nsurgical interventions to make their genitals appear more &#8220;normal,&#8221;\nbut there is a growing movement among intersex people, allies, and\nmedical professionals to replace these often harmful procedures with\nsocial and psychological interventions.\n

\n&#8220;We applaud V-Day for taking a stand against unnecessary and\nunconsentual genital cuttings that are ritually practiced in Western\nsocieties, just as they have stood against unnecessary ritualistic\ngenital cuttings in other cultures,&#8221; said Emi Koyama, the Program\nAssistant for <span class="caps">ISNA</span>. &#8220;I have always respected the work of V-Day on\nbehalf of women and girls, and I am glad to know that V-Day has not\nleft out women and girls born with intersex conditions.&#8221;\n

\nAs part of its commitment to stop violence against intersex people,\nV-Day is urging participants of its College Campaign and Worldwide\nCampaign to raise the awareness about intersex experiences by\ndistributing information about intersex, showing a documentary film,\nor hosting an intersex speaker during this year&#8217;s V-Day activities\nalong with the performances of Eve Ensler&#8217;s &#8220;The Vagina Monologues&#8221;\n(materials about intersex are available from <span class="caps">ISNA</span>). V-Day is also\nencouraging the more than 500 benefit productions of the play to\nconsider contributing a portion of their proceeds to Intersex\nSociety of North America.\n

\n<b class=dr>About V-Day:</b> V-Day is a global movement that helps anti-violence organizations throughout\nthe world continue and expand their core work on the ground, while drawing public attention to the\nlarger fight to stop worldwide violence (including rape, battery, incest,\nfemale genital mutilation (<span class="caps">FGM</span>), sexual slavery) against women and girls.\n

\nV-Day is also a day (on or around Valentine&#8217;s Day in February), for which\nannual theatrical and artistic events are produced around the world to transform consciousness, raise\nmoney, and revitalize the spirit of existing anti-violence organizations.\nEach year, V-Day promotes a series of innovative productions, events and\ninitiatives that are identified collectively as V-Day and the year (i.e.\nV-Day 2001, V-Day 2002, V-Day 2003&#8230;).\n\n\n
