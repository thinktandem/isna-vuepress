title: "New Haven Advocate Looks at Intersex Activism"
---

<br>Many physicians regularly recommend drastic cosmetic surgeries on intersexed infants, usually within the first year and often within the first months of life. The initial procedures are usually followed with hormone treatment and often with further surgeries. The goal is to create an appearance of normality, so that relatives and later sexual partners who see or touch the genitals will not be surprised or upset, and will not transfer their own distress onto the child.<br>

<br>&#8220;The assumption is that the kid won&#8217;t grow up feeling normal if her genitals look bad, because she will be treated like a freak,&#8221; says Dr. Charlotte Boney, a pediatric endocrinologist at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. &#8220;There is little medical evidence to support the assumptions. But there is circumstantial evidence that babies operated on are unhappy.&#8221; ([Read Article][1])<br>
