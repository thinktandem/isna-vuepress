&nbsp;

  
  


"Intersex in the Age of Ethics marks the first 

  
  


time an entire volume has been dedicated to the 

  
  


exploration of the ethics of intersex treatment. 

  
  


It could not be more timely; professional 

  
  


conferences, gender clinics, and the popular 

  
  


media are abuzz with the controversy over how 

  
  


medicine and society should handle intersex 

  
  


and intersexuals. The volume will provide some 

  
  


much-needed perspective. The writings 

  
  


approach the issue of intersexuality and its 

  
  


treatment from numerous perspectives, 

  
  


including the personal, ethical, clinical, legal, 

  
  


anthropological, historical, sociological, and 

  
  


philosophical.

"The range of ethical issues that arise in 

  
  


regard to the treatment of intersex infants, 

  
  


children, and adults is richly representative of 

  
  


the clinical healthcare ethics generally. By 

  
  


incorporating the perspective of patients and 

  
  


their stories in this account, however, 

  
  


Intersex in the Age of Ethics does more than 

  
  


introduce the question of healthcare ethics in 

  
  


microcosm. It also leads the reader to 

  
  


examine the effect of ethical reflection on the 

  
  


lives of patients.

  
  


"Unlike many collections of essays, this one 

  
  


hangs together very well both for reading and 

  
  


for teaching. Intersex in the Age of Ethics is a 

  
  


model, in both senses of the word, of what 

  
  


thoughtful healthcare ethics reflection can 

  
  


accomplish. It embodies a conceptual model of 

  
  


ethical reflection that leads the reader to pose 

  
  


the right questions and to respond to them 

  
  


with patients' lives in mind. And it is a model 

  
  


in the evaluative sense--excellent, admirable, 

  
  


and deserving of imitation."
