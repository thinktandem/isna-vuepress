# Teaching Intersex Issues Returns

<p>After several years on hiatus, <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s teaching kit is back! The newly revised <a href="http://www.isna.org/teaching_kit">Teaching Intersex Issues</a> is now available.  </p>

<p>The teaching kit is designed for undergraduate classes in fields such as Bioethics, Science and Technology Studies, Women&#8217;s Studies, and Cultural Studies and contains two weeks worth of lesson plans, including annotations of key readings and videos, discussion questions, and class activities. The kit also comes with a copy of <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s \*Speakers&#8217; Handbook\*, which contains valuable information about intersex conditions, &#8220;what if?&#8221; scenarios to help educators field difficult questions, and personal narratives from other educators and activists.  </p>
