title: "PFLAG chapter newsletter focuses on intersex"
---

Each month <A href=http://www.pflag.org><span class="caps">PFLAG</span></A> (Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, a national organization with 80,000 members) publishes the _Tips and Tactics_ newsletter for its chapters. The <A href=http://www.pflag.org/chapters/docs/tnt0501.PDF>May 2001 issue</A> is devoted entirely to intersex issues. We applaud <span class="caps">PFLAG</span> for taking this step; with its extensive network of local chapters, <span class="caps">PFLAG</span> has the potential to deliver support for many families struggling with the stigma and isolation of intersexuality. If you are involved with a <span class="caps">PFLAG</span> chapter, encourage them to learn more about intersexuality, starting with <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s website.<br>
