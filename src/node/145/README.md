# ISNA opens new office in Seattle; board expanded; plans launch of medical education video</h2>\n

  


For Immediate Release: February 5, 2003  
  
  
  
SEATTLE, WA - The Intersex Society of North America (ISNA), an  
advocacy and policy group for people with atypical genital and  
reproductive anatomies, has moved its office to Seattle, Washington  
from Petaluma, California.&nbsp; In addition, Dr. Vernon Rosario,  
a physician and medical historian, has joined the Board of Directors.

  


"We hope to reach out to our many allies in the medical  
and bioethics communities in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest,  
as well as pursuing our social change agenda nationally and across  
North America," stated ISNA's Executive Director, Dr. Monica  
Casper, Ph.D." Among other initiatives, we will be launching  
an educational video that will offer the medical community a real  
alternative to unnecessary surgeries on babies with intersex conditions."

  


Dr. Casper was referring to [First,  
Do No Harm: Total Patient Care for Intersex][1], a documentary  
film which presents a patient-centered approach to the health  
needs of people with intersex conditions.&nbsp; New evidence and  
advances in medical ethics have led to the need for revision in  
the standard of care for intersex. Critiquing current medical  
practices and exploring a more ethical and humane approach to  
treatment, the film is compelling, hard-hitting, and deeply moving.

  


The video is currently [available  
for purchase][1] on ISNA's website&nbsp; and will be introduced  
this year to medical schools and medical institutions across the  
country. ISNA is releasing it in conjunction with a medical reform  
"package" that includes information about textbook revision,  
clinical guidelines for teaching intersex issues in medical schools,  
and a parent's handbook.&nbsp; ISNA will also establish a national  
Medical Advisory Committee in 2003.

  


Dr. Vernon Rosario's addition to the Board of Directors will  
strengthen ISNA's ties to the medical community. A child psychiatrist  
in Los Angeles working in private practice and with LGBTI foster  
children, Dr. Rosario received his Ph.D. in the History of Science  
from Harvard University, and his M.D. from the Harvard Medical  
School--M.I.T. Program in Health Sciences and Technology.&nbsp;  
He is a widely published scholar whose&nbsp; current research  
focuses on transgender and intersex children and adolescents.
