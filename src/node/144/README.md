# Cosmo pushes genital surgery

  
  


      
    Havranek, Carrie. 1998. The New Sex Surgeries. Cosmopolitan, November, 146-50.   
      
    The November 1998 issue of Cosmopolitan  
    carried an article which positively  
    gushed about cosmetic genital surgeries.  
    According to author Havranek, women with  
    larger inner labia than outer can benefit  
    from having parts of their labia removed,  
    while women with weak PC muscles can  
    improve their sex lives with "Laser Vaginal  
    Rejuvenation," and inorgasmic women may  
    become easily and multiply orgasmic after   
    pubic mound liposuction.   
      
    Although the article concedes that promises  
    of improved sexual response are unscientific,  
    and cautions that sensation may actually be  
    damaged, it repeatedly calls these procedures   
    "proven safe and effective," and presents  
    only three patients, each of whom makes fantastic  
    claims of sexual benefits.  
      
    ISNA has been contacted by several women  
    who underwent these procedures, with disastrous  
    consequences (sexual dysfunction, chronic pain,  
    cosmetic disfigurement). For one such story,  
    (including an Edo period woodblock celebrating  
    the eroticism of large inner labia!), see _Winged  
    Labia: Deformity or Gift?_.
