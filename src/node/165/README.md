Sources tell us that the radio program All Things Considered will run  
a documentary by Robin White on medicalization of intersexuality this Friday.  
White interviewed the mother who founded the Ambiguous Genitalia Support  
Network; adult intersexuals who spoke about the harm done to them by shame,  
secrecy, and genital surgery; pediatric endocrinologist Dr Dennis Stein;  
Dr. Melvin Grumbach, whose texbook chapters render him an important figure  
in the field of pediatric endocrinology, and Helena Smith, who battled  
doctors determined to surgically assign her son male and who now operates  
the peer support group HELP.
