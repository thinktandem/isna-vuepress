[image:1090 class=bio_image]<br>\*Jeanne Nollman\* has 19 years of experience as a Probation Officer in California, two years of graduate education in counseling, and experience as a Counseling Intern in the California State University system. Happily married for 15 years, Jeanne is the mother of two wonderful adopted children. In 2006, Jeanne ran the workshops for affected teenagers at the annual conference of the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group, to rave reviews (this was the first time that the conference included a programming track specifically for them). At age 18, Jeanne&#8217;s doctors told her partial truths about her diagnosis. After much searching, she discovered at age 25 that she had gonadal dysgenesis (Swyer Syndrome), but it would be 20 years before, with the advent of the intersex activist movement, she was able to find other women with her diagnosis. At <span class="caps">ISNA</span>, Jeanne makes herself available to healthcare professionals in the San Francisco Bay Area to support children with Disorders of Sex Development and their families as well as affected adults.
