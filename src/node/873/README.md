# Our Bodies, Ourselves Includes Intersex

<p>At the start of <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s life, when <a href="/about/chase">Cheryl Chase</a> wondered why the facts of intersex weren&#8217;t included in the women&#8217;s health bible, \_\_Our Bodies, Ourselves\_\_, some people told her intersex was a women&#8217;s health issue.  </p>

<p>Kudos to the Boston Women&#8217;s Health Book Collective for today realizing it is! We&#8217;re thrilled that the <a href="http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/">new edition of \_\_Our Bodies, Ourselves\_\_</a> includes a section on intersex written by members of <span class="caps">ISNA</span>. It even includes a note about <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s mission and how to find our website.  </p>

<p>We&#8217;re especially impressed that the editors included an excerpt from the autobiography of our Board Chair, <a href="/about/moreno">Angela Moreno Lippert</a> as previously published in full in <a href="/books/ageofethics">Intersex in the Age of Ethics</a>. Angela&#8217;s story is shocking and moving, and will help reach out to those \_\_Our Bodies\_\_ readers who have suffered similarly&#8212;and will reach out to those who are committed to helping us push for progressive care for people with intersex. And it will be \_\_quite\_\_ a reach since \_\_Our Bodies\_\_ has sold more than four million copies!  </p>

<p>Special thanks go to our former Executive Director Monica Casper and former board member Esther Morris Leidolf for facilitating this breakthrough. Esther and our Director of Community Relations, <a href="/about/goto">Jane Goto</a> have also been asked to contribute information about the experiences of intersex women for the forthcoming \_\_Our Bodies, Ourselves\_\_ book on menopause.  </p>

<p>We&#8217;re making real progress, people!</p>
