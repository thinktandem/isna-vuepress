        <span class="caps">ISNA</span> Board Member, <a href="/about/goto">Jane Goto</a>, will discuss the history of the intersex movement in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>as part of her presentation &#8220;Intersex & Identity Politics&#8221; at Stockholm Pride. <span class="caps">LGBTQ </span>leaders and a core group of intersex activists in Sweden plan to build an intersex organization, and <span class="caps">ISNA </span>sees Jane’s trip as an invaluable opportunity to forge alliances. Looking to <span class="caps">ISNA </span>as both a model and future collaborator, these leaders are grappling with whether or not to add an “I” to their <span class="caps">LGBTQ </span>groups and what the appropriate goals of intersex activism should be.
