title: "The Vagina Monologues gets it wrong"

"The last recorded clitorectomy in the U.S. occurred in 1948," an actress solemnly intones, and the audience responds with an appreciative feminist fury. But this year, at least 2000 baby girls born in the U.S. will end up under the knife because doctors and parents think their clitoris is "too big" (specifically, more than 3/8 inch). The Vagina Monologues helps keep this dirty secret, but you can read about it in Martha Coventry's [Making the Cut][1] or in Angela Moreno's <a href="http://www.libidomag.com/nakedbrunch/archive/hermaphrodites.html" target="new">In Amerika They Call Us Hermaphrodites</a>.  


  
Doctors think they know what kind of a vagina women should have, and they don't hesitate to perform surgery on girls who don't meet the standard. For instance, when a girl is born with a short or absent vagina, doctors will frequently operate on her, transplanting a piece of her colon to serve as a vagina. The results are often disastrous, but the Vagina Monologues celebrates this surgery. "We're gonna get you the best home-made pussy in America," a father tells his teenage daughter in the play. "And when you get married, your husband is going to know that we had it made just for him!"
