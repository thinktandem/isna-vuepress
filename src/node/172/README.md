For Immediate Release

&nbsp;

  
  


WHAT

  
  


&nbsp;

  
  


Physician's Weekly carries a Point/Counterpoint

  
  


article in which pediatric endocrinologists

  
  


Philip Gruppuso of Brown University and

  
  


Peter Lee of University of Pittsburgh debate

  
  


the advisibility of cosmetic surgery on infants

  
  


born with ambiguous genitals.

  
  


&nbsp;

  
  


&nbsp;

  
  


EXCERPT

  
  


&nbsp;

  
  


LEE: YES First, it would be important for

  
  


me to make a distinction between cosmetic

  
  


and corrective surgery. Cosmetic surgery

  
  


implies that the surgery is done just so

  
  


that the organ has a more pleasing

  
  


appearance. 

  
  


&nbsp;

  
  


GRUPPUSO: NO Surgery is indicated for these

  
  


children to prevent medical complications,

  
  


such as urinary-tract infections. But I no

  
  


longer recommend cosmetic surgery

  
  


during infancy for the purpose of giving

  
  


these children's genitals a more normal

  
  


appearance.
