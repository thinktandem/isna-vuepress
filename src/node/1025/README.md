# Swedish researchers: Genitoplasty outcomes poor

<p>Many U.S. physicians continue to dismiss the results from the London group of researchers, documenting poor outcomes from early genital surgery, as irrelevant. At a recent European Society for Pediatric Urology conference, a <a href="http://www.urotoday.com/prod/contents/confreport/article.asp?cat=confReport&amp;sid=184&amp;tid=412&amp;aid=3474">Swedish group reported similarly poor genitoplasty outcomes</a>.  </p>

<blockquote>
	<p><span class="caps">RESULTS</span>:47 women had been operated, more than 50% had been operated at two or more occasions. 11 patients had only vaginoplasty done and in the remaining women it was combined with clitoroplasty. The cosmetic appearance as well as the function of clitoris and vagina are often not optimal. There is also a need from these patients to be able to discuss former surgery, especially since it was common in this group to state that the functional result has influenced their sexual life negatively.</p>
