1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 3rd Annual AIS Support Group meeting will be held  
on September 12-13, 1998 in Chicago. While we have nearly booked the block  
of rooms at the hotel, if anyone wants information they can obtain it by  
mail by writing to us at 4203 Genesee Ave. #103-436, San Diego, CA 92117  
or calling (619) 569-5254. The meeting is open to adults (and their spouses/partners)  
with AIS, Swyer's Syndrome,&nbsp; Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser, and 5-alpha  
Reductase Deficiency, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all parents/families of  
children with these conditions.

  
  


2.&nbsp; Our e-mail circle (limited to adults with AIS, SS, MRKH, and  
5-aRD) is thriving as we now have 30+ members from around the world who  
are in contact daily. To join the e-mail circle, and obtain the rules governing  
the circle, people can contact Sherri at the above address and phone number.
