MRKH.org is coordinating an educational outreach in collaboration with  
Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) at the upcoming Boston  
production of \_The Vagina Monologues\_ (performed by Eve Ensler herself).  
We are looking for volunteers to help distribute educational materials  
on January 8th at 7pm and 9th at 6:15pm outside of Wilbur Theatre (246  
Tremont St.). Please contact Esther at info@mrkh.org as soon as possible  
if you are available, or if you are going to see the play (it would be  
great to get the information inside the theatre).  


  
MRKH.org is a non-profit organization based in the Boston area that

Kuster-Hauser Syndrome and other related intersex conditions. For more
