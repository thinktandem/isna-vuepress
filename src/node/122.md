<br>MRKH.org is coordinating an educational outreach in collaboration with <br>Intersex Society of North America (<span class="caps">ISNA</span>) at the upcoming Boston <br>production of _The Vagina Monologues_ (performed by Eve Ensler herself). <br>We are looking for volunteers to help distribute educational materials <br>on January 8th at 7pm and 9th at 6:15pm outside of Wilbur Theatre (246 <br>Tremont St.). Please contact Esther at info@mrkh.org as soon as possible <br>if you are available, or if you are going to see the play (it would be <br>great to get the information inside the theatre).<br>
