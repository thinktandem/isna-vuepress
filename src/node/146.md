\n[Portland Mercury][1], the alternative weekly from Portland, Oregon, published a feature story about intersex that is sympathetic to <span class="caps">ISNA</span> and intersex people. Written by Katia Dunn, the article synthesizes interviews with a pediatric endocrinologist from Oregon Health Science University, an intersex person from Portland, and the <span class="caps">ISNA</span> summer intern, also from Portland. From article: &#8220;I think the Intersex Movement has certainly had an influence on my practice,&#8221; he [Dr. Rosenfeld of <span class="caps">OHSU</span>] explains. &#8220;There are definitely occasions when I recommend surgery, but if someone asks me my opinion, I tell them, &#8216;This is what I would do, but there&#8217;s also this movement that recommends this&#8230;&#8217; and then I direct them to <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s website.&#8221; [Read the article][2], and also read our [letter to the editor][3] in the next issue clarifying our position.\n\n
