The workshop will use the history of intersex treatment as a lens through which to consider the question of when medical practice should change. Workshop participants will consider autobiographies of people with intersex conditions as well as the evidence available on intersex treatments to parse out the problem of what to do with faced with conflicting philosophies, claims, and values in medical practice.
