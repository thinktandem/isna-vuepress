<p>Intersex children must be protected from temptation of parents to &#8216;fix&#8217; them surgically.  </p>

<p>December 01, 2004  </p>

<p>By Wendell Roelf  </p>

<p>A law on corrective surgery for children with ambiguous genitals &#8211; intersex children &#8211; was under consideration, the SA Human Rights Commission said yesterday.  </p>

<p>&#8220;We are looking at the practice of surgery; do we need legislation to regulate this area, who should decide, when must the decision be taken?&#8221; said Judith Cohen, parliamentary officer for the commission.  </p>

<p>The commission held a seminar on intersex children yesterday, asking whether gender &#8220;normalisation&#8221; surgery was in the best interests of the child.  </p>

<p>Cohen said the department of justice was also considering amendments to the equality legislation to include intersex in the definition of sex.  </p>

<p>She said debate about intersex children should take place in a human rights framework, particularly when these children challenged the worldview that  <br />
almost exclusively recognised male and female gender.  </p>

<p>Dr Ariane Spitaels, a paediatrician in the University of Stellenbosch&#8217;s faculty of health sciences, said it was necessary to reconsider surgery performed shortly after birth. &#8220;The cut is final and irreversible,&#8221; she said.  </p>

<p>Spitaels said doctors and parents usually did not know before birth if a child was intersex.  </p>

<p>She said parents usually worried about what would happen when the child reached puberty, what their child&#8217;s sexual orientation would be, and whether the child could have children of its own one day.  </p>

<p>Sally Gross, founder of the Intersex Society of South Africa, who was classified as male at birth and known as Selwyn, said the issue concerned human diversity and human rights.  </p>

<p>&#8220;My struggle &#8230; is quite simply to be seen as a human being and not as a walking, talking pathological specimen,&#8221; she said.  </p>

<p>Gross, who escaped gender reassignment surgery, said the temptation to fix things quickly with surgery was a mistake, and legislation was needed to regulate surgery.  </p>

<p>Human rights such as the right not to have one&#8217;s body violated should be fostered. Surgery, however well-intentioned, could be a violation of such rights.  </p>

<p>Most of the gender normalisation surgery performed was feminisation, and the procedure to keep open a pseudo-vagina was &#8220;hellishly painful&#8221; for adults, let alone for toddlers.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Surgery must be measured against hard objective criteria; is this necessary to preserve life or physical health? If not it should not be possible in law  <br />
to perform that surgery.&#8221;  </p>

<p>Gross said South Africa had possibly the world&#8217;s highest prevalence of intersex children, with uncorroborated figures suggesting a national population ratio of 1:500, or about 90 000 individuals.  </p>

<p>Closing the seminar, commission chairman Jody Kollapen said the preamble to the constitution spoke about freeing the potential of each person, and asked whether surgery curtailed this potential.  </p>

<p>&#8220;We have a long way to go, and this is an important step,&#8221; said Kollapen, committing the commission to further engage with issues of discrimination and human rights related to intersex children and adults.  </p>
