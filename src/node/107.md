"Whenever <BR /><br /> physicians are confronted with the fact that <BR /><br /> something that was standard is incorrect, you're <BR /><br /> forced to think about all the damage you did," <BR /><br /> he explains. . . . But, Gruppuso worries that <BR /><br /> doctors are simply unwilling to grant expertise <BR /><br /> to academics in nonmedical disciplines, even <BR /><br /> when it would illuminate their own work. "We <BR /><br /> need to concede that we might be experts on <BR /><br /> the biology and science but not necessarily in <BR /><br /> psychology, sociology, and anthropology. I <BR /><br /> would hazard a guess that Suzanne Kessler <BR /><br /> [author of "Lessons from the Intersexed," <BR /><br /> Rutgers 1998] knows more about these diseases <BR /><br /> than 95% of pediatricians."<BR /><br /> <BR /><br /> One of the most striking examples of a medical <BR /><br /> turnaround is Judson Van Wyk, Kenan Professor <BR /><br /> of Pediatrics at the University of North Carolina <BR /><br /> School of Medicine and the author of the classic <BR /><br /> textbook chapter "Disorders of Sex <BR /><br /> Differentiation" on the diagnosis and surgical <BR /><br /> treatment of intersexual infants. . . . Van Wyk is <BR /><br /> now opposed to many of the protocols he <BR /><br /> helped establish. In his earlier work, "I claimed <BR /><br /> that children should not be assigned male <BR /><br /> unless it is reasonable to expect an adult <BR /><br /> phallus of adequate size. I wrote about the <BR /><br /> tragic outcomes associated with assigning a <BR /><br /> male gender to kids with small penises." ... "I <BR /><br /> would take that back today." He would also take <BR /><br /> back his recommendations that doctors conceal <BR /><br /> intersex diagnoses from parents: "That's one of <BR /><br /> the most damaging things I said in my chapter. <BR /><br /> I myself used to tell families that their child's <BR /><br /> sex was 'unfinished' and compare it to a cleft <BR /><br /> lip; I assumed they could not accept the truth."<BR /><br /> <BR /><br /> <BR /><br /> WHERE <BR /><br /> <BR /><br /> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">Nussbaum, Emily. 1999.
