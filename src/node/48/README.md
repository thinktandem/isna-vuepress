**_New York Times_ on "normalizing" sexual surgeries**</P>  
  


In Today's Science Times pages, historian and ethicist Alice Dreger writes  
about 'When Medicine Goes too Far in the Pursuit of Normality." Today,  
children with a variety of physical differences, including ambiguous genitals,  
are treated by doctors, who believe the children will grow up happier if  
their anatomies can be made normal. Do these treatments work?
