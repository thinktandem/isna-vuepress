# Jane Goto at Stockholm Pride

  
description:  
  


ISNA Board Member, [Jane Goto][1], will discuss the history of the intersex movement in the U.S. as part of her presentation &#8220;Intersex & Identity Politics&#8221; at Stockholm Pride. LGBTQ leaders and a core group of intersex activists in Sweden plan to build an intersex organization, and ISNA sees Jane’s trip as an invaluable opportunity to forge alliances. Looking to ISNA as both a model and future collaborator, these leaders are grappling with whether or not to add an “I” to their LGBTQ groups and what the appropriate goals of intersex activism should be.

  
  


Jane&#8217;s visit to Sweden is sponsored by Stockholm Pride, RFSU The Swedish Association for Sexuality Education, The Swedish Association for Gender Equality, and SHAME.

  
  


We are grateful also to the dedicated and generous ISNA donors who responded with great enthusiasm to our recent request for assistance with incidental expenses. If you are excited about these international outreach efforts, please consider supporting our work financially with a [donation][2] to ISNA.
