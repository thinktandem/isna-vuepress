V-Day, the global movement to stop violence against women and girls,  
announced today its support for the mission of Intersex Society of  
North America (ISNA) to end shame, secrecy and unwanted genital  
surgeries on intersex children, or children born with atypical  
reproductive or sexual anatomies. Currently, the standard protocol  
for treating intersex children involves irreversible and risky  
surgical interventions to make their genitals appear more "normal,"  
but there is a growing movement among intersex people, allies, and  
medical professionals to replace these often harmful procedures with  
social and psychological interventions.  


  
"We applaud V-Day for taking a stand against unnecessary and  
unconsentual genital cuttings that are ritually practiced in Western  
societies, just as they have stood against unnecessary ritualistic  
genital cuttings in other cultures," said Emi Koyama, the Program  
Assistant for ISNA. "I have always respected the work of V-Day on  
behalf of women and girls, and I am glad to know that V-Day has not  
left out women and girls born with intersex conditions."  


  
As part of its commitment to stop violence against intersex people,  
V-Day is urging participants of its College Campaign and Worldwide  
Campaign to raise the awareness about intersex experiences by  
distributing information about intersex, showing a documentary film,  
or hosting an intersex speaker during this year's V-Day activities  
along with the performances of Eve Ensler's "The Vagina Monologues"  
(materials about intersex are available from ISNA). V-Day is also  
encouraging the more than 500 benefit productions of the play to  
consider contributing a portion of their proceeds to Intersex  
Society of North America.

<b class=dr>About V-Day:</b> V-Day is a global movement that helps anti-violence organizations throughout  
the world continue and expand their core work on the ground, while drawing public attention to the  
larger fight to stop worldwide violence (including rape, battery, incest,  
female genital mutilation (FGM), sexual slavery) against women and girls.  


  
V-Day is also a day (on or around Valentine's Day in February), for which  
annual theatrical and artistic events are produced around the world to transform consciousness, raise  
money, and revitalize the spirit of existing anti-violence organizations.  
Each year, V-Day promotes a series of innovative productions, events and  
initiatives that are identified collectively as V-Day and the year (i.e.  
V-Day 2001, V-Day 2002, V-Day 2003...).
