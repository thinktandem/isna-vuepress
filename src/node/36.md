<FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Rolling Stone</I> addresses intersex controversy</FONT>\n\n

The current issue of Rolling Stone contains an extensive article on\n&#8220;John/Joan&#8221; and its implications for the treatment of intersexuals. In\n1967, doctors at Johns Hopkins turned &#8220;John/Joan,&#8221; the victim of a\n  
circumcision accident, into a girl. For 25 years, the case has been\ncited as proof that gender identity could be manufactured by physicians,\nand thus as justification for using surgical convenience as a criterion\nfor assigning sex in infants born with ambiguous genitalia.\n\n

In fact, the experiment was a dismal failure, and today medical specialists\nfinds themselves embroiled in controversy, with their theoretical foundations\nundermined and under pressure from intersex activists demanding an end\nto a model of treatment which views intersexuality as shameful.\n\n

The article &#8220;has already garnered from subscribers (who get early issues)\nthe best, and most gratifyingly outraged, email of any story the magazine\nhas ever published,&#8221; notes author John Colapinto. The journalist plans\nto produce a book length treatment of the strange saga of the twentieth\ncentury&#8217;s enthusiasm for medicalizing ambiguous sex.\n\n
