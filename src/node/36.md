<FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Rolling Stone</I> addresses intersex controversy</FONT><br><br>

The current issue of Rolling Stone contains an extensive article on<br>&#8220;John/Joan&#8221; and its implications for the treatment of intersexuals. In<br>1967, doctors at Johns Hopkins turned &#8220;John/Joan,&#8221; the victim of a<br>  
circumcision accident, into a girl. For 25 years, the case has been<br>cited as proof that gender identity could be manufactured by physicians,<br>and thus as justification for using surgical convenience as a criterion<br>for assigning sex in infants born with ambiguous genitalia.<br><br>

In fact, the experiment was a dismal failure, and today medical specialists<br>finds themselves embroiled in controversy, with their theoretical foundations<br>undermined and under pressure from intersex activists demanding an end<br>to a model of treatment which views intersexuality as shameful.<br><br>

The article &#8220;has already garnered from subscribers (who get early issues)<br>the best, and most gratifyingly outraged, email of any story the magazine<br>has ever published,&#8221; notes author John Colapinto. The journalist plans<br>to produce a book length treatment of the strange saga of the twentieth<br>century&#8217;s enthusiasm for medicalizing ambiguous sex.<br><br>
