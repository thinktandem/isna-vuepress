Classification: [General Intersex Information/Groups][1]

Intersex Initiative (IPDX) is a Portland, Oregon based national activist organization working to end the medical abuse of children born with intersex conditions. We also challenge the medical and social erasure of intersex existence through raising the awareness of issues faced by intersex people.
