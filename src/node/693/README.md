# Help Educate Eve Ensler in Boston!

Subject: Eve Ensler in Boston: Help us educate her!  </p>


<p>Hi, All you <span class="caps">ISNA</span> correspondents in Greater Boston area!  </p>


<p>Please help us to educate Eve Ensler! She&#8217;s coming to Boston this month!  </p>

<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard of The Vagina Monologues. You may not know that  <br />
the book and play promotes the idea that clitorectomy occurs in  <br />
Africa, or perhaps a long time ago in America, but not here and now  <br />
(page 66 in the V-Day edition). There&#8217;s also a dreadful line in the  <br />
play, in which a father tells his daughter, who was born without a  <br />
vagina:  </p>

<blockquote>
	<p>We&#8217;re gonna get you the best home made pussy in America.  <br />
And when you meet your husband, he&#8217;ll know we had it made just for him! (page 99).  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aside from the implication that a woman&#8217;s body should be  <br />
surgically altered purely for the benefit of a hypothetical future  <br />
husband, this passage ignores the realities of what happens to a girl  <br />
when doctors decide to &#8220;fix&#8221; her vagina.  </p>


<p>First, please take a moment to learn about these realities, in the  <br />
following personal narratives by Marguerite Morris and Angela Moreno:  </p>


<p>Morris, Marguerite. 2001. The Missing Vagina Monologue. Sojourner,  <br />
March. Available from http://www.isna.org/library/missingvagina.html.  </p>


<p>Moreno, Angela. 1999. In Amerika They Call Us Hermaphrodites. In  <br />
Intersex in the Age of Ethics, edited by A. D. Dreger. Hagerstown,  <br />
MD: University Publishing Group. Available from  <br />
http://www.libidomag.com/nakedbrunch/archive/hermaphrodites.html.  </p>

<p>Next, you should know that Boston is a major center for genital  <br />
surgeries on intersex infants, and that Eve Ensler will appear later  <br />
this week at an event where audience feedback is encouraged (details  <br />
below). Please go to this event, and raise the issue of genital  <br />
mutilation! Every performance of The Vagina Monologues contributes to  <br />
the invisibility of <span class="caps">IGM</span> (Intersex Genital Mutilation), and makes it  <br />
that much harder to stop.  </p>


<p>If you are going to see The Vagina Monologues, print one of the above  <br />
articles (or pick up the issue of Sojourner) and give it to the  <br />
person behind you in line!  </p>


<p>If you belong to an online activist community, forward this email to  <br />
them, or point them to <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s website (which has a news story on the  <br />
front page about The Vagina Monologues).  </p>


<p>Yours Truly,  </p>
