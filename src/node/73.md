title: Children&#8217;s Book Sale to Support ISNA
---

\n 

From August 1st through August 27th, just in time for the dog days of summer,\n <span class="caps">ISNA</span> will benefit from an online children&#8217;s book sale. But we need\n your help&#8212;and your credit card&#8212;to make it happen!\n 

Patricia Struck, a Chicago-based Usborne Books sales representative and\n <span class="caps">ISNA</span> supporter, has offered to host an e-fair just for us. We will receive\n 20%\n of the profits on all books sold through our e-fair&#8212;a higher yield\n than the company usually offers for such events. Pat, a grandmother of\n three, believes in <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s mission and goals, and she has convinced\n Usborne&#8217;s\n management to support us, too!\n 

This is a wonderful opportunity to help <span class="caps">ISNA</span>\n simply by purchasing books for the children in your life&#8212;something\n you probably already do. What could be better than encouraging kids to\n read, and at the same time helping an\n organization that you care about? To participate in this special e-fair\n for <span class="caps">ISNA</span>, simply go to [www.ubah.com/k1916][1], enter the bookstore, select &#8220;e-fairs,&#8221; and\n click on &#8220;<span class="caps">ISNA</span>.&#8221; It&#8217;s that easy!\n 

Award-winning Usborne\n is a major distributor of &#8220;the books that kids\n love to read.&#8221; The company offers over 1,200 educational, colorful,\n and fun titles covering activities, puzzles, and a wide range of subjects\n for children of all ages.
