title: "Children&#8217;s Book Sale to Support ISNA"
---

  


From August 1st through August 27th, just in time for the dog days of summer,  
ISNA will benefit from an online children&#8217;s book sale. But we need  
your help&#8212;and your credit card&#8212;to make it happen!

  


Patricia Struck, a Chicago-based Usborne Books sales representative and  
ISNA supporter, has offered to host an e-fair just for us. We will receive  
20%  
of the profits on all books sold through our e-fair&#8212;a higher yield  
than the company usually offers for such events. Pat, a grandmother of  
three, believes in ISNA&#8217;s mission and goals, and she has convinced  
Usborne&#8217;s  
management to support us, too!

  


This is a wonderful opportunity to help ISNA  
simply by purchasing books for the children in your life&#8212;something  
you probably already do. What could be better than encouraging kids to  
read, and at the same time helping an  
organization that you care about? To participate in this special e-fair  
for ISNA, simply go to [www.ubah.com/k1916][1], enter the bookstore, select &#8220;e-fairs,&#8221; and  
click on &#8220;ISNA.&#8221; It&#8217;s that easy!

  


Award-winning Usborne  
is a major distributor of &#8220;the books that kids  
love to read.&#8221; The company offers over 1,200 educational, colorful,  
and fun titles covering activities, puzzles, and a wide range of subjects  
for children of all ages.
