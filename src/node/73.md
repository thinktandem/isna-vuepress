title: "Children&#8217;s Book Sale to Support ISNA"
---

<br> 

From August 1st through August 27th, just in time for the dog days of summer,<br> <span class="caps">ISNA</span> will benefit from an online children&#8217;s book sale. But we need<br> your help&#8212;and your credit card&#8212;to make it happen!<br> 

Patricia Struck, a Chicago-based Usborne Books sales representative and<br> <span class="caps">ISNA</span> supporter, has offered to host an e-fair just for us. We will receive<br> 20%<br> of the profits on all books sold through our e-fair&#8212;a higher yield<br> than the company usually offers for such events. Pat, a grandmother of<br> three, believes in <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s mission and goals, and she has convinced<br> Usborne&#8217;s<br> management to support us, too!<br> 

This is a wonderful opportunity to help <span class="caps">ISNA</span><br> simply by purchasing books for the children in your life&#8212;something<br> you probably already do. What could be better than encouraging kids to<br> read, and at the same time helping an<br> organization that you care about? To participate in this special e-fair<br> for <span class="caps">ISNA</span>, simply go to [www.ubah.com/k1916][1], enter the bookstore, select &#8220;e-fairs,&#8221; and<br> click on &#8220;<span class="caps">ISNA</span>.&#8221; It&#8217;s that easy!<br> 

Award-winning Usborne<br> is a major distributor of &#8220;the books that kids<br> love to read.&#8221; The company offers over 1,200 educational, colorful,<br> and fun titles covering activities, puzzles, and a wide range of subjects<br> for children of all ages.
