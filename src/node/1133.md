        <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ISNA</span></span> Board Member and Bay Area outreach volunteer, <a href="/node/1082">Jeanne Nollman</a>, and former <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ISNA</span></span> Board Chair, <a href="/about/thea_hillman">Thea Hillman</a>, team up to discuss gender/anatomy/sex and how these relate to <a href="/node/1066">Disorders of Sex Development</a>. The purpose is to create a safe space that encourages and facilitates students&#8217; ability to learn about their bodies, explore their sexuality, and expand their understanding of diversity.
