&nbsp;<br><br>

Physician&#8217;s Weekly carries a Point/Counterpoint<br><br>

article in which pediatric endocrinologists<br><br>

Philip Gruppuso of Brown University and<br><br>

Peter Lee of University of Pittsburgh debate<br><br>

the advisibility of cosmetic surgery on infants<br><br>

born with ambiguous genitals.<br><br>

&nbsp;<br><br>

&nbsp;<br><br>

<span class="caps">EXCERPT</span><br><br>

&nbsp;<br><br>

<span class="caps">LEE</span>: <span class="caps">YES</span> First, it would be important for<br><br>

me to make a distinction between cosmetic<br><br>

and corrective surgery. Cosmetic surgery<br><br>

implies that the surgery is done just so<br><br>

that the organ has a more pleasing<br><br>

appearance. <br><br>

&nbsp;<br><br>

<span class="caps">GRUPPUSO</span>: NO Surgery is indicated for these<br><br>

children to prevent medical complications,<br><br>

such as urinary-tract infections. But I no<br><br>

longer recommend cosmetic surgery<br><br>

during infancy for the purpose of giving<br><br>

these children&#8217;s genitals a more normal<br><br>

appearance. <br><br>
