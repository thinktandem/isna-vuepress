&nbsp;\n\n

Physician&#8217;s Weekly carries a Point/Counterpoint\n\n

article in which pediatric endocrinologists\n\n

Philip Gruppuso of Brown University and\n\n

Peter Lee of University of Pittsburgh debate\n\n

the advisibility of cosmetic surgery on infants\n\n

born with ambiguous genitals.\n\n

&nbsp;\n\n

&nbsp;\n\n

<span class="caps">EXCERPT</span>\n\n

&nbsp;\n\n

<span class="caps">LEE</span>: <span class="caps">YES</span> First, it would be important for\n\n

me to make a distinction between cosmetic\n\n

and corrective surgery. Cosmetic surgery\n\n

implies that the surgery is done just so\n\n

that the organ has a more pleasing\n\n

appearance. \n\n

&nbsp;\n\n

<span class="caps">GRUPPUSO</span>: NO Surgery is indicated for these\n\n

children to prevent medical complications,\n\n

such as urinary-tract infections. But I no\n\n

longer recommend cosmetic surgery\n\n

during infancy for the purpose of giving\n\n

these children&#8217;s genitals a more normal\n\n

appearance. \n\n
