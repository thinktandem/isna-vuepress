<FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Urology Times</I> revisits intersex controversy</FONT><br><br>

&#8220;Into the sea of controversy surrounding the treatment of intersex children<br>has swept a new tidal wave of opinion,&#8221; notes Urology Times writer Anne<br>Sheck. This is the third Urology Times article to examine the debate in<br>a year.<br><br>

At first glance, the title&#8217;s mention of a &#8220;conservative turn&#8221; in professional<br>thinking about intersex treatment might be thought to refer to the continued<br>rigid insistence upon early genital surgery by the American Academy of<br>Pediatrics and the rejection by many clinicians of the voices of inter-<br>  
sex activists.<br><br>

Instead, the title refers to a wave of support for a halt to early cosmetic<br>surgery &#8212; one surgeon expressed his hope that we are seeing the beginning<br>of a return to a more conservative surgical approach.<br><br>

Dr. William Reiner, a child psychiatrist and former urological surgeon<br>at Hopkins, concurs with such<br>  
recommendations of <span class="caps">ISNA</span> and of (Diamond and Sigmundson 1997) that some<br>highly virilized <span class="caps">CAH</span><br>  
infants be raised male.Scheck says Dr. Reiner told her he agrees &#8220;in<br>essence&#8221; with <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s position,<br>  
which advocates that children be allowed to participate directly in<br>treatment<br>  
decisions. He added a caveat that extensive psychological testing ought<br>to be done to affirm the sex role before surgery is considered.<br><br>

Still, Scheck learned that the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American<br>Urological Association, and the National Association of Perinatal Medicine<br>  
see no reason to reconsider their stances.<br><br>
