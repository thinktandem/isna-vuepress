<FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Urology Times</I> revisits intersex controversy</FONT>\n\n

&#8220;Into the sea of controversy surrounding the treatment of intersex children\nhas swept a new tidal wave of opinion,&#8221; notes Urology Times writer Anne\nSheck. This is the third Urology Times article to examine the debate in\na year.\n\n

At first glance, the title&#8217;s mention of a &#8220;conservative turn&#8221; in professional\nthinking about intersex treatment might be thought to refer to the continued\nrigid insistence upon early genital surgery by the American Academy of\nPediatrics and the rejection by many clinicians of the voices of inter-\n  
sex activists.\n\n

Instead, the title refers to a wave of support for a halt to early cosmetic\nsurgery &#8212; one surgeon expressed his hope that we are seeing the beginning\nof a return to a more conservative surgical approach.\n\n

Dr. William Reiner, a child psychiatrist and former urological surgeon\nat Hopkins, concurs with such\n  
recommendations of <span class="caps">ISNA</span> and of (Diamond and Sigmundson 1997) that some\nhighly virilized <span class="caps">CAH</span>\n  
infants be raised male.Scheck says Dr. Reiner told her he agrees &#8220;in\nessence&#8221; with <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s position,\n  
which advocates that children be allowed to participate directly in\ntreatment\n  
decisions. He added a caveat that extensive psychological testing ought\nto be done to affirm the sex role before surgery is considered.\n\n

Still, Scheck learned that the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American\nUrological Association, and the National Association of Perinatal Medicine\n  
see no reason to reconsider their stances.\n\n
