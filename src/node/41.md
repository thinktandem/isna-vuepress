<FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Urology Times</I> revisits intersex controversy</FONT>  
  


"Into the sea of controversy surrounding the treatment of intersex children  
has swept a new tidal wave of opinion," notes Urology Times writer Anne  
Sheck. This is the third Urology Times article to examine the debate in  
a year.  
  


At first glance, the title's mention of a "conservative turn" in professional  
thinking about intersex treatment might be thought to refer to the continued  
rigid insistence upon early genital surgery by the American Academy of  
Pediatrics and the rejection by many clinicians of the voices of inter-  
  
sex activists.  
  


Instead, the title refers to a wave of support for a halt to early cosmetic  
surgery -- one surgeon expressed his hope that we are seeing the beginning  
of a return to a more conservative surgical approach.  
  


Dr. William Reiner, a child psychiatrist and former urological surgeon  
at Hopkins, concurs with such  
  
recommendations of ISNA and of (Diamond and Sigmundson 1997) that some  
highly virilized CAH  
  
infants be raised male.Scheck says Dr. Reiner told her he agrees "in  
essence" with ISNA's position,  
  
which advocates that children be allowed to participate directly in  
treatment  
  
decisions. He added a caveat that extensive psychological testing ought  
to be done to affirm the sex role before surgery is considered.  
  


Still, Scheck learned that the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American  
Urological Association, and the National Association of Perinatal Medicine  
  
see no reason to reconsider their stances.
