ABSTRACT  
  


Under current medical practice, when a child is born intersex, sex is  
assigned and medical/&nbsp;&nbsp; surgical intervention is undertaken.  
This practice is criticized by the Intersex Society of North&nbsp;&nbsp;  
America and by feminist scholars. Together they are creating a "politics  
of difference" approach in which differences are not seen as "defects"  
to be corrected. This paper analyzes the reasons offered in support of  
current medical practice and of the politics of difference, and argues  
for a move toward the latter. Crucial to the determination that this move  
is warranted are justice concerns and the emergence of support groups and  
technologies that allow geographically separated individuals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
to form a relevant "group."
