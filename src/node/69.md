Under current medical practice, when a child is born intersex, sex is\nassigned and medical/&nbsp;&nbsp; surgical intervention is undertaken.\nThis practice is criticized by the Intersex Society of North&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAmerica and by feminist scholars. Together they are creating a &#8220;politics\nof difference&#8221; approach in which differences are not seen as &#8220;defects&#8221;\nto be corrected. This paper analyzes the reasons offered in support of\ncurrent medical practice and of the politics of difference, and argues\nfor a move toward the latter. Crucial to the determination that this move\nis warranted are justice concerns and the emergence of support groups and\ntechnologies that allow geographically separated individuals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nto form a relevant &#8220;group.&#8221;\n\n
