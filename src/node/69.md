<span class="caps">ABSTRACT</span><br><br>

Under current medical practice, when a child is born intersex, sex is<br>assigned and medical/&nbsp;&nbsp; surgical intervention is undertaken.<br>This practice is criticized by the Intersex Society of North&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>America and by feminist scholars. Together they are creating a &#8220;politics<br>of difference&#8221; approach in which differences are not seen as &#8220;defects&#8221;<br>to be corrected. This paper analyzes the reasons offered in support of<br>current medical practice and of the politics of difference, and argues<br>for a move toward the latter. Crucial to the determination that this move<br>is warranted are justice concerns and the emergence of support groups and<br>technologies that allow geographically separated individuals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>to form a relevant &#8220;group.&#8221;<br><br>
