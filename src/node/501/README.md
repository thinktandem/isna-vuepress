# What’s happening at ISNA in 2004?

In 2004 ISNA’s energies are focused on reforming U.S. medical education with regard to intersex.  
We’ve learned that one of the best ways to effect positive change for people dealing with intersex (including parents) is to positively influence the up-and-coming generation of doctors. So we are going to sweep the nation’s medical schools this year as we build a foundation for a world free of shame, secrecy, and unwanted genital surgeries for people born with atypical anatomies!  
  
Leading the charge is our Executive Director Cheryl Chase (founder of ISNA) and our Board of Directors and Medical Advisory Board. We are thrilled to have a grant of $20,000 from the Arcus Foundation and a grant of $16,000 from David Cameron and Peter Tannen in support of our efforts. Watch this space for updates on our achievements, information about how you can help, and new downloadable educational materials.
