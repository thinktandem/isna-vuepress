# Intersex in Australia: More of Same

<p>What has happened to people with intersex in countries outside North America?  </p>

<p>Read the story of Tony Briffa of Australia at the website of Melbourne&#8217;s <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/01/31/1107020318710.html">The Age</a>. You&#8217;ll see there how the <a href="/faq/concealment">concealment-centered</a> model of treatment developed at Johns Hopkins in the 1950s spread across the world, unintentionally hurting people with intersex as far away as Australia.  </p>

<p>An important thing to note: Though the title of this article is &#8220;Choosing the Right Gender,&#8221; being assigned the &#8220;wrong&#8221; gender (the gender he didn&#8217;t ultimately identify with) is just a part of Tony&#8217;s story. He also tells a story of being medically displayed &#8220;like a freak&#8221;, being lied to and mislead, and struggling with his sexuality following his medical treatment.  </p>

<p>There are some signs that Australian healthcare is starting to move towards the <a href="/faq/patient-centered">patient-centered</a> advocated by <span class="caps">ISNA</span>, but there is still much work to be done!  </p>

<p>So please consider <a href="/donate">donating</a> to support our efforts. And make sure children like Tony Briffa born tomorrow are offered truth, autonomy, and the psycho-social support they need.</p>
