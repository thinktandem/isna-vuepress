The next meeting of the Bay Area XXY Support Group is Sunday, April 23 from 10 a.m. – noon in the auditorium at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford in Palo Alto, CA.  
  
  
  
Nicole Tartaglia, M.D, will speak about behavioral and emotional profiles in XXY, Symptoms and Treatment of ADHD (Inattention, Hyperactivity, Impulsivity) in XXY and Social Development and Autism Spectrum Disorders in XXY. She will also conduct a focus group regarding the medical, developmental and behavioral health care needs of your child. She recently received a grant through the American Academy of Pediatrics to fund the planning process for the development of a multidisciplinary clinic for patients with X&Y chromosome variations. This clinic would include assessments by a team including a developmental pediatrician, psychologist, endocrinologist, speech and occupational therapists and other professionals all with expertise in treating children and young adults with X&Y chromosome variations.
