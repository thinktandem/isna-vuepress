&nbsp;\n\n

"Intersex in the Age of Ethics marks the first \n\n

time an entire volume has been dedicated to the \n\n

exploration of the ethics of intersex treatment. \n\n

It could not be more timely; professional \n\n

conferences, gender clinics, and the popular \n\n

media are abuzz with the controversy over how \n\n

medicine and society should handle intersex \n\n

and intersexuals. The volume will provide some \n\n

much-needed perspective. The writings \n\n

approach the issue of intersexuality and its \n\n

treatment from numerous perspectives, \n\n

including the personal, ethical, clinical, legal, \n\n

anthropological, historical, sociological, and \n\n

philosophical.\n\n

"The range of ethical issues that arise in \n\n

regard to the treatment of intersex infants, \n\n

children, and adults is richly representative of \n\n

the clinical healthcare ethics generally. By \n\n

incorporating the perspective of patients and \n\n

their stories in this account, however, \n\n

Intersex in the Age of Ethics does more than \n\n

introduce the question of healthcare ethics in \n\n

microcosm. It also leads the reader to \n\n

examine the effect of ethical reflection on the \n\n

lives of patients.\n\n

"Unlike many collections of essays, this one \n\n

hangs together very well both for reading and \n\n

for teaching. Intersex in the Age of Ethics is a \n\n

model, in both senses of the word, of what \n\n

thoughtful healthcare ethics reflection can \n\n

accomplish. It embodies a conceptual model of \n\n

ethical reflection that leads the reader to pose \n\n

the right questions and to respond to them \n\n

with patients&#8217; lives in mind. And it is a model \n\n

in the evaluative sense&#8212;excellent, admirable, \n\n

and deserving of imitation."\n\n
