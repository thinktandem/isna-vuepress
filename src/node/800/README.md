# Update of our FAQ's

<p>To better educate our audiences, we&#8217;ve updated the <span class="caps">FAQ</span>&#8217;s (Frequently Asked Questions). To take a look, just go to <a href="/faq">www.isna.org/faq</a>.  </p>

<p>A number of spiffy navigation tools have also been added to make your &#8220;travel&#8221; around the <span class="caps">FAQ</span>&#8217;s easier.  </p>

<p>Those of you who are teachers will be especially pleased to hear that we&#8217;ve also included a way to access an <a href="/faq/printable">printer-friendly version</a> of the revised <span class="caps">FAQ</span>&#8217;s. Feel free to print that and use it in your classes with attribution to <span class="caps">ISNA</span>.  </p>

<p>To continue to serve the thousands of visitors we get each month&#8212;new parents, adults who have just learned they have an intersex condition, clinicians, students, and teachers&#8212;we&#8217;ll keep augmenting, editing, and updating <span class="caps">FAQ</span>s. (For example, we still need to complete the section on intersex conditions, and provide a segment on the biology of sex development.) But if you know an <span class="caps">FAQ</span> we should consider posting, please <a href="/about/contact">send it along to us</a>.  </p>

<p>If you use our website, or refer others to it, please consider <a href="/donate">donating</a> to support the cost of its upkeep. Thanks!</p>
