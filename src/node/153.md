NORTH AMERICAN TASK FORCE ON INTERSEX FORMED  
  
SEEKS BROAD INTERDISCIPLINARY CONSENSUS ON TREATMENT  


The North American Task Force on Intersex (NATFI) has been formed in  
response to the growing debate over standards of practice for medical treatment  
of intersex children. Until a few years ago, these standards were uncontroversial.  
Now, however, the standards face criticism from patient advocate groups.  
In addition, the story of David Reimer, published in John Colapinto's book  
As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl, is receiving extensive  
media attention.  


The Task Force was formed by Ian Aaronson MD, a pediatric urologist  
at the Medical University of South Carolina. Aaronson has, over the past  
decades, cared for many intersex patients and is the author of chapters  
on the subject in several medical textbooks.  


"We are committed to learn from past mistakes in order to offer the  
best advice and treatment to our patients in the future," said Aaronson.  
"Long term outcome data is very sparse and selective, and this puts surgeons  
on tenuous ethical grounds. I was very gratified at the positive response  
from members of the professional community and the patient advocate groups  
to the notion of forming a Task Force."  


NATFI brings together specialists in surgery, endocrinology, psychology,  
ethics, psychiatry, epidemiology, genetics, public health and representatives  
of intersex patient advocate groups. With the participation of representatives  
of the Intersex Society of North America and the AIS Support Group, the  
Task Force is the first decision-making body on intersex medical care to  
have included intersex patient advocates. "We are committed to achieving  
consensus on these all-important patient care issues," said Aaronson.  


The Task Force, under Aaronson's chairmanship, is expected to address  
a number of issues, including 1) establishment of standards for informed  
consent, 2) retrospective review of the long term psychosexual status of  
patients treated for intersex, 3) establishment of guidelines for the management  
of children born with ambiguous sex anatomy, 4) initiation of a prospective  
registry, and 5) revision of medical nomenclature.  


The Task Force, an independent and self-governing body, has been endorsed  
by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Urological Association,  
the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American College  
of Medical Genetics, the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, the  
Society for Pediatric Urology, the Society for Fetal Urology, and the Society  
of Genitourinary Reconstructive Surgeons.
