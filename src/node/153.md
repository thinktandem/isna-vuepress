The North American Task Force on Intersex (<span class="caps">NATFI</span>) has been formed in\nresponse to the growing debate over standards of practice for medical treatment\nof intersex children. Until a few years ago, these standards were uncontroversial.\nNow, however, the standards face criticism from patient advocate groups.\nIn addition, the story of David Reimer, published in John Colapinto&#8217;s book\nAs Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl, is receiving extensive\nmedia attention.\n

The Task Force was formed by Ian Aaronson MD, a pediatric urologist\nat the Medical University of South Carolina. Aaronson has, over the past\ndecades, cared for many intersex patients and is the author of chapters\non the subject in several medical textbooks.\n

&#8220;We are committed to learn from past mistakes in order to offer the\nbest advice and treatment to our patients in the future,&#8221; said Aaronson.\n&#8220;Long term outcome data is very sparse and selective, and this puts surgeons\non tenuous ethical grounds. I was very gratified at the positive response\nfrom members of the professional community and the patient advocate groups\nto the notion of forming a Task Force.&#8221;\n

<span class="caps">NATFI</span> brings together specialists in surgery, endocrinology, psychology,\nethics, psychiatry, epidemiology, genetics, public health and representatives\nof intersex patient advocate groups. With the participation of representatives\nof the Intersex Society of North America and the <span class="caps">AIS</span> Support Group, the\nTask Force is the first decision-making body on intersex medical care to\nhave included intersex patient advocates. &#8220;We are committed to achieving\nconsensus on these all-important patient care issues,&#8221; said Aaronson.\n

The Task Force, under Aaronson&#8217;s chairmanship, is expected to address\na number of issues, including 1) establishment of standards for informed\nconsent, 2) retrospective review of the long term psychosexual status of\npatients treated for intersex, 3) establishment of guidelines for the management\nof children born with ambiguous sex anatomy, 4) initiation of a prospective\nregistry, and 5) revision of medical nomenclature.\n

The Task Force, an independent and self-governing body, has been endorsed\nby the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Urological Association,\nthe American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American College\nof Medical Genetics, the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, the\nSociety for Pediatric Urology, the Society for Fetal Urology, and the Society\nof Genitourinary Reconstructive Surgeons.\n
