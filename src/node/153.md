The North American Task Force on Intersex (<span class="caps">NATFI</span>) has been formed in<br>response to the growing debate over standards of practice for medical treatment<br>of intersex children. Until a few years ago, these standards were uncontroversial.<br>Now, however, the standards face criticism from patient advocate groups.<br>In addition, the story of David Reimer, published in John Colapinto&#8217;s book<br>As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl, is receiving extensive<br>media attention.<br>

The Task Force was formed by Ian Aaronson MD, a pediatric urologist<br>at the Medical University of South Carolina. Aaronson has, over the past<br>decades, cared for many intersex patients and is the author of chapters<br>on the subject in several medical textbooks.<br>

&#8220;We are committed to learn from past mistakes in order to offer the<br>best advice and treatment to our patients in the future,&#8221; said Aaronson.<br>&#8220;Long term outcome data is very sparse and selective, and this puts surgeons<br>on tenuous ethical grounds. I was very gratified at the positive response<br>from members of the professional community and the patient advocate groups<br>to the notion of forming a Task Force.&#8221;<br>

<span class="caps">NATFI</span> brings together specialists in surgery, endocrinology, psychology,<br>ethics, psychiatry, epidemiology, genetics, public health and representatives<br>of intersex patient advocate groups. With the participation of representatives<br>of the Intersex Society of North America and the <span class="caps">AIS</span> Support Group, the<br>Task Force is the first decision-making body on intersex medical care to<br>have included intersex patient advocates. &#8220;We are committed to achieving<br>consensus on these all-important patient care issues,&#8221; said Aaronson.<br>

The Task Force, under Aaronson&#8217;s chairmanship, is expected to address<br>a number of issues, including 1) establishment of standards for informed<br>consent, 2) retrospective review of the long term psychosexual status of<br>patients treated for intersex, 3) establishment of guidelines for the management<br>of children born with ambiguous sex anatomy, 4) initiation of a prospective<br>registry, and 5) revision of medical nomenclature.<br>

The Task Force, an independent and self-governing body, has been endorsed<br>by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Urological Association,<br>the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American College<br>of Medical Genetics, the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, the<br>Society for Pediatric Urology, the Society for Fetal Urology, and the Society<br>of Genitourinary Reconstructive Surgeons.<br>
