We&#8217;re pleased to announce the publication of [Fool for Love][1] by [Lisa Lees][2]:&#8220;Lisa Lees&#8221;:http://www.lisalees.com/ is a long time <span class="caps">ISNA</span> supporter and [Fool for Love][1] is a young adult novel that offers a realistic and caring narrative about a high school student named Jami and her partner Carys. <br><br>In a world where representations matter and many young intersex and/or queer people seldom see themselves reflected in characters in literature or film, [Fool for Love][1] centers Jami&#8217;s experience with her intersex condition, highlighting her loving relationships with her parents and her partner as well as her struggles against people&#8217;s homophobic attitudes and misunderstanding of what it means to have an intersex condition. In addition, [Fool for Love][1] weaves references to <span class="caps">ISNA</span>, Hermaphrodites with Attitude, and <span class="caps">PFLAG</span> throughout its narrative, offering young readers useful information about where they might learn more about these issues and even find support and allies. <br><br>We&#8217;re grateful to Lisa for taking on this project and hope other authors will follow!<br><br>[Fool for Love][1] is available for purchase at [lulu.com][3]
