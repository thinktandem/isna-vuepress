<BR />\n<I>Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex</I><A NAME="top"></A>\n<BR />\nby Alice Domurat Dreger <BR />\nHarvard University Press, May 1998 <BR />\nHardcover, 320 pages</P>\n\n

<P>
  Alice Dreger, Assistant Professor of Science and Technology Studies at\nMichigan State University and adjunct faculty at the Center for Ethics and\nHumanities in the Life Sciences, brings us this study of how and why medical\nand scientific men have construed sex, gender, and sexuality as they <BR />\nhave. A 36 page long epilogue contains narratives of intersexuals treated\naccording to the still-standard medical protocols developed in the 1950s\nand calls for change: "Surely, &#8230;it will be familiarity rather than\nknowlege that finally takes away [intersexuals&#8217;] supposed &#8216;strangeness.&#8217;"

  From Dreger&#8217;s Introduction:
</P>\n\n

<P>
  I hope the reader will use the history that follows to think about many\nbroader and related issues. In [this research] I have learned not only about\nthe history of biology, medicine, unusual bodies, and the history of the\nunexpected and changing answers to [the question: How do you know if you&#8217;re\na boy or a girl]. I have also learned about culture, about technology and\nlanguage, about what the body could mean, does mean, and perhaps should\nmean, in the life of the person. &#8230;I have learned about how and why it\nis that scientists and doctors work to mediate the relationships between\nour bodies and ourselves. I have also learned much about why it is we often\nlook to scientists and medical doctors to read or even to alter our bodies.

<P>
  I [now] realize how complicated life can be if one has a body or a being\nthat stands out from <BR />\nthe rest. And do not we all? Surely in some way every one of us is like\na hermaphrodite, a being <BR />\nor a body that won&#8217;t quite fit the boundaries. So I do not think of this\nintellectual journey only <BR />\nas a detailed history of sex, gender, and sexuality. I think of it as an\nexploration of what it means <BR />\nto have a body and a being in this day and age.
