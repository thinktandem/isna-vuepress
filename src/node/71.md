<BR /><br /><I>Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex</I><A NAME="top"></A><br /><BR /><br />by Alice Domurat Dreger <BR /><br />Harvard University Press, May 1998 <BR /><br />Hardcover, 320 pages</P><br /><br />

<P>
  Alice Dreger, Assistant Professor of Science and Technology Studies at<br />Michigan State University and adjunct faculty at the Center for Ethics and<br />Humanities in the Life Sciences, brings us this study of how and why medical<br />and scientific men have construed sex, gender, and sexuality as they <BR /><br />have. A 36 page long epilogue contains narratives of intersexuals treated<br />according to the still-standard medical protocols developed in the 1950s<br />and calls for change: "Surely, ...it will be familiarity rather than<br />knowlege that finally takes away [intersexuals'] supposed 'strangeness.'"

  From Dreger's Introduction:
</P>

<br /><br />

<P>
  I hope the reader will use the history that follows to think about many<br />broader and related issues. In [this research] I have learned not only about<br />the history of biology, medicine, unusual bodies, and the history of the<br />unexpected and changing answers to [the question: How do you know if you're<br />a boy or a girl]. I have also learned about culture, about technology and<br />language, about what the body could mean, does mean, and perhaps should<br />mean, in the life of the person. ...I have learned about how and why it<br />is that scientists and doctors work to mediate the relationships between<br />our bodies and ourselves. I have also learned much about why it is we often<br />look to scientists and medical doctors to read or even to alter our bodies.

  I [now] realize how complicated life can be if one has a body or a being<br />that stands out from <BR /><br />the rest. And do not we all? Surely in some way every one of us is like<br />a hermaphrodite, a being <BR /><br />or a body that won't quite fit the boundaries. So I do not think of this<br />intellectual journey only <BR /><br />as a detailed history of sex, gender, and sexuality. I think of it as an<br />exploration of what it means <BR /><br />to have a body and a being in this day and age.
