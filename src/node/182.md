  Abstract: The prevalent policy of assignment of gender to children born\nwith ambiguous genitalia has recently been questioned from both biological\nand social-constructionist perspectives. This paper comments on the debate\nfrom the perspective of the clinician involved in the psychosocial management\nof intersexuality. It argues for only minor changes of the policy until\na more extensive <BR />\ndata base is available that permits a firmly grounded revision.

  "Ignore the somewhat trendy title, which might seem to threaten\nyet another piece of pretentious postmodernism. This is a well-researched,\nsober history of a problem that Alice Dreger shows has directly affected\nmore people than we might think and which shapes the sense of sexual identity\nof <BR />\nus all."
</P>\n\n

<P>
  "Avoiding preachy judgmentalism, Dreger shows us how deeply ingrained\nare our assumptions about gender normality (sexual anatomy is destiny),\nand on how flimsy a basis they have been grounded. The book offers us all\na lesson in self-awareness."
