**Journal of Clinical Ethics Special Issue Focuses on Intersex**  


The current number of the Journal of Clinical Ethics (v.9 no.4 Winter  
98) is a special issue devoted to the ethics  
  
of medical management of intersexuality.  


_From the introductions:_  
  
The articles in this issue of JCE ask how intersexuals should be medically  
treated, based on what we know now. They urge, above all else, that surgeons  
no longer operate on infants born with ambiguous genitals to create "more  
normal looking" genitals.  
  
Edmund G. Howe, Editor in Chief  


Without a doubt, the speed with which the intersex scene has been changing  
during this decade seems to indicate a major paradigm shift.&nbsp; . .  
. In the end, all intersexuals are now asking is to be treated according  
to the same ethical principles as everybody else. This volume seeks to  
explore what that would mean.  
  
Alice Domurat Dreger, Editor (special issue)
