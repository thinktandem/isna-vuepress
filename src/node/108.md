[<br><img src="/img/newsci.jpg" width=124 height=168 align=right border=0>][1]<br>Sue Elford, who chairs a <span class="caps">CAH</span> support group, spends a lot of time talking to new parents. &#8220;If it had been my daughter I would willingly have had everything made &#8216;normal&#8217;, as they call it, as soon as possible. But now, you know, it frightens me because it often isn&#8217;t the best thing.&#8221; She thinks that if parents are told the full implications of surgery, how little is understood about the long-term benefits, the scar tissue, and potential for lost sensation, they will be better armed to make good decisions for their children and more likely to realise that appearances aren&#8217;t everything. &#8220;They should be given all the facts, which I feel isn&#8217;t always done,&#8221; says Elford.
