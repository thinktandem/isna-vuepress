title: "On the Word Hermaphrodite"
---

<br> 

The word &#8220;hermaphrodite&#8221; is a stigmatizing and misleading word. <br> There is growing momentum to eliminate the word &#8220;hermaphrodite&#8221; <br> from medical literature and to use the word &#8220;intersex&#8221; in its <br> place. While some intersex people do reclaim the word &#8220;hermaphrodite&#8221; <br> with pride to reference themselves (like words such as &#8220;dyke&#8221; <br> and &#8220;queer&#8221; have been reclaimed by <span class="caps">LGBT</span> people), it should be <br> generally avoided except under specific circumstances. <br> 

<br>Victorian doctors believed that the gonads were the seat of "true<br>sex," and thus created a system of nomenclature &#8212; in the absence of<br>any knowledge of genetics, endocrinology, or embryology &#8212; which categorized<br>people as "male pseudohermaphrodite," "female pseudohermaphrodite,"<br>or "true hermaphrodite." It&#8217;s time to eliminate this quaint Victorianism<br>from modern medical practice.<br><br>

The word "hermaphrodite" implies that a person is born with<br>two sets of genitals &#8212; one male and one female &#8212; and this is something<br>that cannot occur.<br><br>

The qualifiers "male" and "female," because they<br>are based only upon the gonadal histology, frequently contradict the sex<br>of assignment, and thus are very misleading and disturbing for parents and<br>patients.<br><br>

The qualifiers "pseudo" and "true" are even more<br>harmful, because they imply a sort of authenticity, or lack of same, that<br>carry powerful emotional baggage.<br><br>

You can learn more about the Victorian history of these labels in Alice<br>Dreger&#8217;s book "Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex."<br>Look for it at our <A HREF="/library/bookshelf.html#anchor18410">bookshelf</A>.<br>
