title: On the Word "Hermaphrodite"
---

\n 

The word &#8220;hermaphrodite&#8221; is a stigmatizing and misleading word. \n There is growing momentum to eliminate the word &#8220;hermaphrodite&#8221; \n from medical literature and to use the word &#8220;intersex&#8221; in its \n place. While some intersex people do reclaim the word &#8220;hermaphrodite&#8221; \n with pride to reference themselves (like words such as &#8220;dyke&#8221; \n and &#8220;queer&#8221; have been reclaimed by <span class="caps">LGBT</span> people), it should be \n generally avoided except under specific circumstances. \n 

\nVictorian doctors believed that the gonads were the seat of "true\nsex," and thus created a system of nomenclature &#8212; in the absence of\nany knowledge of genetics, endocrinology, or embryology &#8212; which categorized\npeople as "male pseudohermaphrodite," "female pseudohermaphrodite,"\nor "true hermaphrodite." It&#8217;s time to eliminate this quaint Victorianism\nfrom modern medical practice.\n\n

The word "hermaphrodite" implies that a person is born with\ntwo sets of genitals &#8212; one male and one female &#8212; and this is something\nthat cannot occur.\n\n

The qualifiers "male" and "female," because they\nare based only upon the gonadal histology, frequently contradict the sex\nof assignment, and thus are very misleading and disturbing for parents and\npatients.\n\n

The qualifiers "pseudo" and "true" are even more\nharmful, because they imply a sort of authenticity, or lack of same, that\ncarry powerful emotional baggage.\n\n

You can learn more about the Victorian history of these labels in Alice\nDreger&#8217;s book "Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex."\nLook for it at our <A HREF="/library/bookshelf.html#anchor18410">bookshelf</A>.\n
