title: Suggestions to V-Day Coordinators & Intersex Allies
---

For many college campuses, V-Day events offer an important opportunity to educate audiences about women’s lives, women’s bodies, and violence against women. Intersex activists have always applauded these efforts but were also saddened that _The Vagina Monologues_ made certain assumptions about women’s bodies and gave audiences the impression that genital mutilation only occurs outside the United States. Some V-Day coordinators were sympathetic to intersex activists who voiced their concerns by writing letters and, partly as a result of those letters, those coordinators began to donate portions of proceeds from V-Day events to <span class="caps">ISNA</span> so that we can educate people about intersex conditions, unwanted genital surgeries and help to end stigma and shame. \n\nStill, a great deal of work needs to be done. Many people still aren’t aware of the struggles that intersex people face, and V-Day remains an important opportunity for educating audiences and for helping support <span class="caps">ISNA</span>’s work. Here are some specific ways you can use your V-Day event to support <span class="caps">ISNA</span> and its constituents. \n\n* Distribute information about <span class="caps">ISNA</span> and intersex at your V-day Event. Print out some of <span class="caps">ISNA</span>’s [Frequently Asked Questions][1] intersex and pass them out at the performance or include them in your V-Day program.\n\n* Ask that Esther Liedolf Morris’s [The Missing Vagina Monologue][2] be included in your V-Day performance or given its own stage time. \n\n* Order materials about intersex and use them to educate your campus. Order one of our [videos][3] or order our teaching kit for undergraduates that will be available in Spring of 2006.\n\n* Invite a speaker from <span class="caps">ISNA</span>’s [Speakers Bureau][4] to come to your campus. You can host a speaker as part of your V-day events or at any time of year you choose. \n\n* Endorse a resolution in support of <span class="caps">ISNA</span>’s work. Both V-Day and the National Organization of Women have passed resolutions similar to [this model resolution][5]* Ask your campus V-Day coordinators to donate a portion of V-Day proceeds to <span class="caps">ISNA</span>. Even a contribution of 5-10% of your total proceeds can help <span class="caps">ISNA</span> continue its important work to end shame, stigma, and unwanted genital surgeries. You can make your donation [online][6] or [mail][7] your donation to <span class="caps">ISNA</span>. After we receive your contribution, we’ll send you a letter that acknowledges your donation. \n\n\n
