title: "Suggestions to V-Day Coordinators & Intersex Allies"
---

<p>For many college campuses, V-Day events offer an important opportunity to educate audiences about women’s lives, women’s bodies, and violence against women. Intersex activists have always applauded these efforts but were also saddened that \_The Vagina Monologues\_ made certain assumptions about women’s bodies and gave audiences the impression that genital mutilation only occurs outside the United States. Some V-Day coordinators were sympathetic to intersex activists who voiced their concerns by writing letters and, partly as a result of those letters, those coordinators began to donate portions of proceeds from V-Day events to <span class="caps">ISNA</span> so that we can educate people about intersex conditions, unwanted genital surgeries and help to end stigma and shame.  </p>

<p>Still, a great deal of work needs to be done. Many people still aren’t aware of the struggles that intersex people face, and V-Day remains an important opportunity for educating audiences and for helping support <span class="caps">ISNA</span>’s work. Here are some specific ways you can use your V-Day event to support <span class="caps">ISNA</span> and its constituents.  </p>

<ul>
	<li>Distribute information about <span class="caps">ISNA</span> and intersex at your V-day Event. Print out some of <span class="caps">ISNA</span>’s <a href="http://www.isna.org/faqabout">Frequently Asked Questions</a> intersex and pass them out at the performance or include them in your V-Day program.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Ask that Esther Liedolf Morris’s <a href="http://www.isna.org/missingvagina">The Missing Vagina Monologue</a> be included in your V-Day performance or given its own stage time.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Order materials about intersex and use them to educate your campus. Order one of our <a href="http://www.isna.org/videos">videos</a> or order our teaching kit for undergraduates that will be available in Spring of 2006.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Invite a speaker from <span class="caps">ISNA</span>’s <a href="http://www.isna.org/about/speakers/">Speakers Bureau</a> to come to your campus. You can host a speaker as part of your V-day events or at any time of year you choose.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Endorse a resolution in support of <span class="caps">ISNA</span>’s work. Both V-Day and the National Organization of Women have passed resolutions similar to <a href="http://www.isna.org/node/78">this model resolution</a>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Ask your campus V-Day coordinators to donate a portion of V-Day proceeds to <span class="caps">ISNA</span>. Even a contribution of 5-10% of your total proceeds can help <span class="caps">ISNA</span> continue its important work to end shame, stigma, and unwanted genital surgeries. You can make your donation <a href="/donate">online</a> or <a href="http://www.isna.org/about/contact">mail</a> your donation to <span class="caps">ISNA</span>. After we receive your contribution, we’ll send you a letter that acknowledges your donation.</li>
