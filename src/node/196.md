  <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under\n Florida law, unless there is a judicial decree to the contrary, the decision-maker\n for a minor�s health care decisions are the minor�s natural parents.&nbsp; A �minor� is\n defined by Florida Statute as �any person who has not attained the age\n of 18 years.�&nbsp; � 1.01(13), Fla. Stat. (2001).&nbsp; A natural parent\n has the right to the custody of his or her child absent conduct or conditions\n that justify a deprivation of the right in the interest of the welfare\n of the child and such a legal right should not be lightly regarded.&nbsp; <u>Torres\n v. Van Eepoel</u>, 98 So.2d 735 (Fla. 1958).&nbsp; The right to consent\n to medical treatment will typically reside in the parents who have the\n legal responsibility to maintain and support their child.&nbsp; <u>O�Keefe\n v. Orea</u>, 731 So.2d 680 (Fla. 1st <span class="caps">DCA</span> 1998). Although the parents� right\n to determine their child�s health care decisions is not absolute and there\n is some judicial authority to override the parents� authority, the courts\n have repeatedly held that it is the parents and their medical advisors\n that generally must make these decisions.&nbsp; <u>In re Guardianship of\n Barry</u>, 445 So.2d 365 (Fla. 2d <span class="caps">DCA</span> 1984).&nbsp; The love and affection\n of another person, no matter how great, is insufficient to deprive a fit\n and proper parent of the decision-making authority over his or her child.&nbsp; <u>Modacsi\n v. Taylor</u>, 104 So.2d 664 (Fla. 1st <span class="caps">DCA</span> 1958).&nbsp; In situations where\n there has been an adoption or a dissolution of marriage, the judicial decree\n will typically assign the decision-making authority to the adoptive parents\n or custodial parent.&nbsp; <u>See generally</u> Ch. 61, 63, Fla.

State, Dept.\n of Health and Rehabilitative Services</u>, 462 So.2d 1160 (Fla. 2d <span class="caps">DCA</span> 1984).&nbsp; Medical\n care may also be furnished in the absence of parental consent if the parents\n have refused to give permission because of religious beliefs.&nbsp; <u>J.V.\n v.

<p style='text-align:justify;\n'>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In <u>M.N.</u>, the parents challenged an �order\n by which medical treatment was authorized for their eight-month old child\n B.N., without their consent.�&nbsp; <u>M.N.</u>, 648 So.2d at 770.&nbsp; The\n child was admitted by the parents at the hospital, where she was diagnosed\n with acute monocytic leukemia, severe anemia and a low platelet count.&nbsp; Chemotherapy\n was then recommended as the most appropriate treatment for the child�s\n life-threatening condition, which necessitated blood transfusions.&nbsp; The\n parents refused to consent to this procedure based on their religious beliefs.&nbsp; <u>M.N.</u>,\n 648 So.2d at 770.&nbsp; The hospital filed an emergency petition requesting\n an order as to whether chemotherapy and blood transfusions might be administered\n to the child without parental consent.&nbsp; In addition to their religious\n objections, the parents expressed concern that the proposed medical treatment\n would cause undue suffering to their child.&nbsp; After an evidentiary\n hearing, the trial judge entered an order authorizing the proposed medical\n treatment.&nbsp; <u>M.N.</u>, 648 So.2d at 770.&nbsp; The parents then\n appealed the order to the First District Court of Appeal.&nbsp; </span>
</p>\n <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The First District then stated the law to be applied\n setting out the obligations of the trial court in applying the law.&nbsp; </p>\n 

<p style='\ntext-align:justify;'>
  <span\nstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; Ordinarily, decisions regarding the care and\n upbringing of minor children will be left to the parents.&nbsp; This parent-child\n relationship is a fundamental liberty interest which is constitutionally\n protected.&nbsp; <u>Padgett v. Department of Health and Rehabil-itative\n Services</u>, 577 So.2d 565 (Fla.1991); <u>In Re R.W.</u>, 495 So.2d 133\n (Fla.1986); <u>see</u> <u>In Re Dubreuil</u>, 629 So.2d 819, 827 n. 11\n (Fla.1993).&nbsp; But the parents&#8217; rights are not absolute, as the state\n has parens patriae authority to ensure that children receive reasonable\n medical treatment which is necessary for the preservation of life.&nbsp; <u>J.V.\n v. State</u>, 516 So.2d 1133 (Fla. 1st <span class="caps">DCA</span> 1987).&nbsp; And as between\n parent and child, the ultimate welfare of the child is the controlling\n factor.&nbsp; <u>State v. Reeves</u>, 97 So.2d 18 (Fla.1957).&nbsp; Indeed,\n the policy of advancing the best interests of the child is well rooted\n in this state and guides the courts in many diverse contexts.&nbsp; <u>See,\n e.g.</u>, <u>Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services v. Privette</u>,\n 617 So.2d 305 (Fla.<b> </b></span><span\nstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>1993); <u>Padgett; Dinkel v. Dinkel</u>, 322 So.2d 22\n (Fla.1975).</span>
</p>\n 

<p style='\ntext-align:justify;'>
  <span\nstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; The state may override the fundamental liberty\n interest in the parent-child relationship only when there is a sufficiently\n compelling state interest.&nbsp; <u>In Re Guardianship of Browning</u>,\n 568 So.2d 4 (Fla.1990); <u>Dubreuil</u>.&nbsp; Furthermore, the state&#8217;s\n action must be narrowly tailored so as to produce the least intrusive interference\n with individual rights, although the preservation of life has been described\n as the most significant state interest.&nbsp; <u>Browning</u>.&nbsp; As\n with the parent-child relationship, the state&#8217;s <i>parens patriae</i></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> authority\n is thus not entirely unfettered.&nbsp; Rather, the state&#8217;s interest diminishes\n as the severity of an affliction and the likelihood of death increase:</span>
</p>\n 

<p style='\ntext-align:justify;'>
  <span\nstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>[T]here is a substantial distinction in the State&#8217;s\n insistence that human life be saved where the affliction is curable, as\n opposed to the State interest where &#8230; the issue is not whether, but when,\n for how long and at what cost to the individual &#8230; life may be briefly\n extended.</span>

</p>\n 

<p style='\ntext-align:justify;'>
  <span\nstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; The constitutional right of privacy may afford\n an individual suffering from a terminal illness the right to refuse medical\n treatment. <u>Satz v. Perlmutter</u>, 379 So.2d 359 (Fla.1980); <u>see\n also</u> <u>Public Health Trust v. Wons</u>, 541 So.2d 96 (Fla.1989).&nbsp; This\n right has been extended to incompetent persons and to infants.&nbsp; <u>John\n F. Kennedy Hosp.</u>; <u>Barry</u>.&nbsp; As Barry indicates, courts sometimes\n rely on the doctrine of substituted judgment in effectuating the privacy\n right of incompetent patients.&nbsp; Under this doctrine the court attempts\n to ascertain the choice which would have been made by the patient, if competent.&nbsp; However, <u>Barry</u> recognizes\n the inherent difficulty in applying this concept to young children.</span>
</p>\n 

<p style='\ntext-align:justify;'>
  <span\nstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; There is no brightline rule or presumption that\n applies to the dispute here at issue.&nbsp; An illustrative listing of\n cases addressing this problem can be found in <u>Newmark v. Williams</u>,\n 588 A.2d 1108 (Del. 1991).&nbsp; But the courts must carefully consider\n the facts and circumstances of each individual case as it arises, in weighing\n the various competing interests.&nbsp; Medical treatment may thus be rejected\n when the evidence is not sufficiently compelling to establish the primacy\n of the state&#8217;s interest, or that the child&#8217;s own welfare would be best\n served by such treatment.&nbsp; <u>See</u> <u>Barry</u>; <u>Newmark</u>.&nbsp; On\n the other hand, the parents&#8217; wishes may be overcome when there is sufficient\n medical evidence to invoke the state&#8217;s parens patriae authority, and to\n establish that the child&#8217;s welfare will be best served by the disputed\n treatment.&nbsp; <u>See, e.g.</u>, <u>In Re Cabrera</u>, 381 Pa.Super.\n 100, 552 A.2d 1114 (1989); <u>In Re Wilmann</u>, 24 Ohio App.3d 191, 493\n N.E.2d 1380 (1986); <u>In Re Hamilton</u>, 657 S.W.2d 425 (Tenn.App.1983); <u>Custody\n of a Minor</u>, 375 Mass. 733, 379 N.E.2d 1053 (1978).</span>

<p style='text-align:justify;\n'>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The First District then concluded that �in the\n present case it is not entirely clear whether the court fully considered\n all of the competing interests involved.�&nbsp; <u>M.N.</u>, 648 So.2d\n at 771.&nbsp; �Given the nature of this dispute, we conclude that the matter\n should be remanded so as to ensure a balanced weighing of the various interests.�&nbsp; <u>M.N.</u>,\n 648 So.2d at 771.&nbsp; �This necessitates [the] consideration of the parents� interest\n in making fundamental decisions regarding the care of their child, the\n state&#8217;s interest in preserving human life, and the child&#8217;s own welfare\n and best interests, in light of the severity of the child&#8217;s illness, the\n likelihood as to whether the proposed treatment will be effective, the\n child&#8217;s chances of survival with and without such treatment, and the invasiveness\n and nature of the treatment with regard to its effect on the child.�&nbsp; <u>M.N.</u>,\n 648 So.2d at 771.&nbsp; Accordingly, it remanded the case to the trial\n court for a further evidentiary hearing on these issues.&nbsp; <u>M.N.</u>,\n 648 So.2d at 772.&nbsp; In view of the considerations set out by the First\n District, and the past history of the Florida courts in these types of\n cases, it appears quite evident that the majority of trial judges will\n authorize the medical treatment for minors in such circumstances.&nbsp; </span>

</p>\n <p class=MsoBodyText3>The state may have several interests in the issue of\n whether a patient may forego medical treatment.&nbsp; 

<u>See</u> <u>In re\n Dubreuil</u>, 629 So.2d 819, 822 (Fla. 1993); <u>In re Guardianship of Browning</u>,\n 568 So.2d 4, 11 (Fla. 1990); <u>In re Guardianship of Schiavo</u>, 780 So.2d\n 176 (Fla. 2d <span class="caps">DCA</span> 2001).&nbsp; The health care practitioner or provider, however,\n may not have standing to assert these interests in a petition to require\n medical treatment for a patient.&nbsp; <u>See</u> <u>In re Dubreuil</u>.&nbsp; At\n least for blood transfusion cases, the Florida Supreme Court removed standing\n from the health care practitioner and provider on grounds that there was\n a potential conflict of interest in requiring health care practitioners and\n providers to contest the wishes of their own patients.&nbsp; <u>In re Dubreuil</u>; <u>Harrell\n v. St. Mary&#8217;s Hospital, Inc.</u>, 678 So.2d 455 (Fla. 4th <span class="caps">DCA</span> 1996).&nbsp; Nevertheless,\n in the case of <u>M.N.</u>, the hospital successfully brought a petition\n against the parents.&nbsp; If the health care provider does not have standing,\n the issue then becomes who does have standing.&nbsp; The answer to this question\n may lie in Rule 5.900, Florida Probate Rules.&nbsp; </p>\n

<p style='text-align:justify;\n'>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>In 1989, the Second District Court\n of Appeal issued a lengthy decision describing in dicta a method for judicial\n review of a surrogate�s decision regarding the substituted judgment of\n an incapacitated elderly patient.&nbsp; <u>In re Guardianship of Browning</u>,\n 543 So.2d 258 (Fla. 2d <span class="caps">DCA</span> 1989).&nbsp; After the Florida Supreme Court\n reviewed the Second District�s decision, it realized the importance of\n creating an expedited judicial procedure for these types of decisions and\n requested the Probate Rules Committee to submit to it a proposed rule.&nbsp; <u>In\n re Guardianship of Browning</u>, 568 So.2d 4 n. 17 (Fla. 1990).&nbsp; In\n 1991, the court created Rule 5.900, Florida Probate Rules, to assist this\n legal procedure.&nbsp; Rule 5.900, on its face, is not limited to situations\n involving elderly patients and appears to apply to all cases involving\n expedited judicial intervention concerning medical treatment procedures.&nbsp; It\n allows any �interested person� to file a petition.&nbsp; Rule 5.900 cautions\n attorneys to �note that the criteria and standards of proof contained in <u>Browning</u> differ\n from the criteria and standards of proof presently existing in chapter\n 765, Florida Statutes.�&nbsp; Fla.Prob.R. 5.900.&nbsp; Accordingly, a careful\n review of Rule 5.900 is critical.&nbsp; </span>

</p>\n <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>

**A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction**</p>\n <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>The legal doctrine of informed consent is well\n accepted in the health care profession and the law.&nbsp; By now, generally\n limited by only their own financial constraints and resources, almost all\n patients understand that they have the right to make their health care decisions.&nbsp; This\n right, of course, exists even if the patients� health care provider knows\n better.&nbsp; As set out above, in the case of a minor, the minor�s parents\n typically make the minor�s health care decisions.&nbsp; In the case of an\n incompetent person, a guardian or surrogate or proxy makes the health care\n decisions after determining what health care is in the best interest of the\n incompetent person.&nbsp; The right to make a health care decision, of course,\n rests upon an informed basis for the decision, hence the term �informed consent.�&nbsp; Informed\n consent has been enumerated in several different sources of law, including\n the federal constitution, state constitutions, federal statutes, state statutes,\n and of course, the common law.&nbsp; As a general rule, a health care provider\n must obtain the informed consent of a patient for treating, examining, or\n operating on that individual.&nbsp; � 766.103(3), Fla. Stat. (2001).&nbsp; A\n failure to do so may result in liability for negligent treatment.&nbsp; An\n exception exists for emergency medical treatment that falls within the �Good\n Samaritan Act.�&nbsp; � 768.13, Fla. Stat. (2001).&nbsp; </p>\n

</p>\n 

<p style='text-align:justify;\n'>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In <span style='color:black'><u>Cruzan v. Director,\n Missouri Department of Health</u>, 497 U.S. 261, 110 S.Ct. 2841, 111\n L.Ed.2d 224 (1990), the United States Supreme Court made clear that �a\n competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest\n in refusing unwanted medical treatment.�&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>, 497 U.S.\n at 278.&nbsp; �This notion of bodily integrity has been embodied in\n the requirement that informed consent is generally required for medical\n treatment.�&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>, 497 U.S. at 269.&nbsp; �The informed\n consent doctrine has become firmly entrenched in American tort law.&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>,\n 497 U.S. at 269.&nbsp; �The logical corollary of the doctrine of informed\n consent is that the patient generally possesses the right not to consent,\n that is, to refuse treatment.�&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>, 497 U.S. at 270.&nbsp; Although <u>Cruzan</u> involved\n the right to refuse life-sustaining treatment issue due to �the advance\n of medical technology capable of sustaining life well past the point\n where natural forces would have brought certain death in earlier times,� <u>Cruzan</u>,\n 497 U.S. at 270, its holding on informed consent applies with equal\n force to any issue involving informed consent.&nbsp; In fact, most\n of the early cases that discussed informed consent involved the right\n to refuse medical treatment based upon a patient�s religious beliefs.&nbsp; When\n the courts base decisions on the federal constitution, it typically\n means that the federal government or a state government has enacted\n a statute that encroached upon or limits a patient�s right to consent\n to a health care procedure or treatment or the right to receive information\n in order to make an informed consent.&nbsp; </span></span>
</p>\n 

<p style='text-align:justify;\n'>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>�But determining that a person has\n a �liberty interest� under the Due Process Clause does not end the inquiry.�&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>,\n 497 U.S. at 279.&nbsp; Rather, the issue of �whether [a person�s] constitutional\n rights have been violated must be determined by balancing his liberty interests\n against the relevant state interests.�&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>, 497 U.S. at\n 270.&nbsp; Thus, although a competent person may have the right to refuse\n unwanted medical treatment, the Supreme Court recognized that there are\n situations where that liberty right may not be violated by a state that\n prohibits the exercise of that right under certain circumstances.&nbsp; The\n Supreme Court then reviewed the factual circumstances involving Ms. Cruzan,\n an incompetent, where Missouri had a statute that �requires that evidence\n of the incompetent�s wishes as to the withdrawal of treatment be proved\n by clear and convincing evidence.�&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>, 497 U.S. at 280.&nbsp; �The\n question, then, is whether the United States Constitution forbids the establishment\n of this procedural requirement by the State.�&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>, 497\n U.S. at 280.&nbsp; The Supreme Court held that it did not.&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>,\n 497 U.S. at 280.&nbsp; </span>
</p>\n 

<p style='\ntext-align:justify;'>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; Petitioners go on\n to assert that an incompetent person should possess the same right in this\n respect as is possessed by a competent person. . . . The difficulty with\n petitioners&#8217; claim is that in a sense it begs the question:&nbsp; An incompetent\n person is not able to make an informed and voluntary choice to exercise\n a hypothetical right to refuse treatment or any other right.&nbsp; Such\n a "right" must be exercised for her, if at all, by some sort\n of surrogate.&nbsp; Here, Missouri has in effect recognized that under\n certain circumstances a surrogate may act for the patient in electing to\n have hydration and nutrition withdrawn in such a way as to cause death,\n but it has established a procedural safeguard to assure that the action\n of the surrogate conforms as best it may to the wishes expressed by the\n patient while competent.&nbsp; Missouri requires that evidence of the incompetent&#8217;s\n wishes as to the withdrawal of treatment be proved by clear and convincing\n evidence.&nbsp; The question, then, is whether the United States Constitution\n forbids the establishment of this procedural requirement by the State.&nbsp;&nbsp; We\n hold that it does not.</span>
</p>\n 

<p style='\ntext-align:justify;'>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; Whether or not Missouri&#8217;s\n clear and convincing evidence requirement comports with the United States\n Constitution depends in part on what interests the State may properly seek\n to protect in this situation.&nbsp; Missouri relies on its interest in\n the protection and preservation of human life, and there can be no gainsaying\n this interest.&nbsp; As a general matter, the States&#8212;indeed, all civilized\n nations&#8212;demonstrate their commitment to life by treating homicide as a\n serious crime.&nbsp; Moreover, the majority of States in this country have\n laws imposing criminal penalties on one who assists another to commit suicide.&nbsp; We\n do not think a State is required to re-main neutral in the face of an informed\n and voluntary decision by a physically able adult to starve to death.</span>
</p>\n 

<p style='\ntext-align:justify;'>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; But in the context\n presented here, a State has more particular interests at stake.&nbsp; The\n choice between life and death is a deeply personal decision of obvious\n and overwhelming finality.&nbsp; We believe Missouri<b> </b></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>may\n legitimately seek to safeguard the personal element of this choice through\n the imposition of heightened evident-iary requirements.&nbsp; It cannot\n be disputed that the Due Process Clause protects an interest in life as\n well as an interest in refusing life-sustaining medical treatment.&nbsp; Not\n all incompetent patients will have loved ones available to serve as surrogate\n decision-makers.&nbsp; And even where family members are present, "[t]here\n will, of course, be some unfortunate situations in which family members\n will not act to protect a patient."<i>&nbsp; </i></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><u>In\n re Jobes</u><i>,</i></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> 108 N.J. 394,\n 419, 529 A.2d 434, 447 (1987).&nbsp; A State is entitled to guard against\n potential abuses in such situations.&nbsp; Similarly, a State is entitled\n to consider that a judicial proceeding to make a determination regarding\n an incompetent&#8217;s wishes may very well not be an adversarial one, with the\n added guarantee of accurate factfinding that the adversary process brings\n with it.&nbsp; <u>See</u><i> </i></span><span\nstyle='font-size:12.0pt'><u>Ohio v.

  <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; We think it self-evident\n that the interests at stake in the instant proceedings are more substantial,\n both on an individual and societal level, than those involved in a run-of-the-mine\n civil dispute.&nbsp; But not only does the standard of proof reflect the\n importance of a particular adjudication, it also serves as "a societal\n judgment about how the risk of error should be distributed between the\n litigants."&nbsp; <u>Santosky</u>, <u>supra</u>, 455 U.S. at 755,\n 102 S.Ct., at 1395; <u>Addington</u>, <u>supra</u>, 441 U.S., at 423, 99\n S.Ct., at 1807-1808.&nbsp; The more stringent the burden of proof a party\n must bear, the more that party bears the risk of an erroneous decision.&nbsp; We\n believe that Missouri may permissibly place an increased risk of an erroneous\n decision on those seeking to terminate an incompetent individual&#8217;s life-sustaining\n treatment.&nbsp; An erroneous decision not to terminate results in a maintenance\n of the status quo; the possibility of subsequent developments such as advancements\n in medical science, the discovery of new evidence regarding the patient&#8217;s\n intent, changes in the law, or simply the unexpected death of the patient\n despite the administration of life-sustaining treatment at least create\n the potential that a wrong decision will eventually be corrected or its\n impact mitigated.&nbsp; An erroneous decision to with-draw life-sustaining\n treatment, however, is not susceptible of correction.&nbsp; </span>

  <span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>Significantly, in addition to the\n clear and convincing evidence standard, the United States Supreme Court\n also held that states are not constitutionally required to accept the �substituted\n judgment� of a patient�s close family member absent substantial proof that\n their views reflected the views of the incompetent patient.&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>,\n 497 U.S. at 286.&nbsp; </span>
</p>\n <p class=MsoBlockText>&nbsp; It is also worth noting that most, if not all,\n States simply forbid oral testimony entirely in determining the wishes of\n parties in transactions which, while important, simply do not have the consequences\n that a decision to terminate a person&#8217;s life does.&nbsp; At common law and\n by statute in most States, the parol evidence rule prevents the variations\n of the terms of a written contract by oral testimony.&nbsp; The statute of\n frauds makes unenforceable oral contracts to leave property by will, and\n statutes regulating the making of wills universally require that those instruments\n be in writing.&nbsp;

</p>\n <p class=MsoBodyText3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Separate\n from the United States Constitution, the Florida Supreme Court has recognized\n that the Florida Constitution �guarantees that �a competent person has the\n constitutional right to choose or refuse medical treatment, and that right\n extends to all relevant decisions concerning one�s health.��&nbsp;

Wons</u>, 541 So.2d 96 (Fla. 1989).&nbsp; The Florida Supreme Court\n premised this right upon a person�s right to privacy under Article I, section\n 23, of the Florida Constitution.&nbsp; It recognized, however, that where\n the issue involves a blood transfusion, the privacy right �overlaps with\n the right to freely exercise one�s religion.�&nbsp; <u>In re Dubreuil</u>,\n 629 So.2d at 822.&nbsp; In a prior decision, the court held that a terminally\n ill incompetent person�s right to refuse medical treatment is the same as\n a competent person�s right to refuse medical treatment.&nbsp; <u>John F.\n Kennedy Memorial Hospital, Inc. v.

<p style='text-align:justify;'>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>to\n the timing of surgical intervention.&nbsp; It is the informed consent and\n specifics of the information provided that will ultimately determine whether\n or not the healthcare provider has adhered to the applicable standard of\n care in dealing with the situation.&nbsp; Recent events and studies have\n raised some concerns about the traditional of early surgical intervention\n and the psychological ramifications.&nbsp; It is the recommendation of\n this author that these issues be communicated to the patients and/or their\n parents.&nbsp; Thus, the recommendation is for a more expansive informed\n consent that has traditionally been given when confronting these issues.&nbsp; This\n author recognizes that there is not legal decision in this country squarely\n on point.&nbsp; However, the emergence of peer reviewed literature suggesting\n potential harm for early surgical treatment to patients creates a situation\n where the healthcare practitioner must take these matters into account.&nbsp; Therefore,\n the&nbsp; more cautious approach should be to at least notify the decision-maker\n of the issues.&nbsp; It is recommended that this additional component be\n incorporated into the more traditional informed consent document, so that\n there is a clear written record that the information was in fact communicated.&nbsp; Of\n course, the precise information and language of the informed consent will\n be determined based upon the specifics of the individual set of patient\n circumstances. </span>

This appears to be based upon the initial research\n and opinions set forth by Dr. John Money.&nbsp; Additionally, support for\n early intervention has been set forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics\n in a policy statement issued April 1996.&nbsp; American Academy of Pediatrics\n Volume 97, Number 4, April 1996.&nbsp; In the policy statement, the academy\n recommended surgery for orchidopexy and hypospadias to be performed between\n six and 12 months of age.&nbsp; This policy statement helps define the\n standard of care with respect to the timing of elective surgery on the\n genitalia of children born with genital abnormalities.&nbsp; It should\n be noted that the American Board of Pediatrics issued an addendum to their\n 1996 position as published in Pediatrics 2000; 106:138-142.&nbsp; The Academy\n stated �the 2000 policy on Developmental Anomalies of the External Genitalia\n acknowledges the considerable recent debate about the appropriate general\n assignment of newborns with the most extremes forms of genitalia ambiguity,\n and notes that some have suggested that the current early surgical treatment\n be abandoned in favor for allowing the affected person to participate in\n gender assignment at a later time.�&nbsp; Recent studies and literature\n suggests that there is an emerging issue with regard to the appropriate\n timing of surgical intervention.&nbsp; As greater and more expansive studies\n are undertaken, the standard of care with respect to the timing of surgical\n intervention may in fact evolve.&nbsp;

At the present time\n however, this author has not located any legislature or court within the\n United States that has directly addressed these issues and the responsibilities\n of the healthcare practitioner with respect to them.&nbsp; There has been,\n however, one case decided in Columbia that has considered the issues.</span></p>\n 

# **B.&nbsp; Columbia�s\n Decision**\n The Columbian Constitution Court issued two decisions.&nbsp; One\n on May 12, 1999 and the other on August 2, 1999 which addressed issues\n of surgical intervention in sexually ambiguous infants.&nbsp; The Court\n found that �parents cannot give consent on a child�s behalf on surgeries\n intended to determine sexual identity.�&nbsp; The Court indicated that\n children older than five (5) years of age are the appropriate persons to\n consent to surgeries to determine their sex.&nbsp; Additionally, in the\n other Order the Court found the Informed Consent given to parents of a\n child under the age of five (5) to be insufficient.&nbsp; At the present\n time I have been unable to obtain an English translation of these decisions.&nbsp; Assuming,\n however, that the English articles are accurate several questions come\n immediately to mind.&nbsp; First, a comparison of the Constitution of Columbia\n would need be compared to our own.&nbsp; There are perhaps some fundamental\n differences which could have a bearing upon the basis of the decision.&nbsp; Secondly,\n it is virtually impossible to imagine a scenario where a United States\n Court would allow a minor to consent to a surgical procedure.&nbsp; As\n stated previously in this article minors do not have the ability to enter\n into a legally binding contract.&nbsp; Since a medical consent is in fact\n a binding agreement minors would lack capacity to enter into it.&nbsp; One\n final thought on the Columbia case centers on their displeasure with the\n Informed Consent.&nbsp; As stated again it is likely that any decision\n in the United States will turn upon the issue of Informed Consent.&nbsp; Therefore,\n the issue that is presented in the Columbia case may be relevant to demonstrate\n to healthcare professionals Courts general attitude towards an adequate\n Informed Consent.&nbsp; </span></h2>\n 

# **C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Related Cases**\n There are a number of related cases that although they\n are not authoritative on the issues at hand are none the less illustrative\n of the Court�s attitude towards a variety of issues respecting surgical\n sex changes.&nbsp; I include the 

<u>Littleton v. Prange</u> case cited\n in the 288<sup>th</sup> Judicial District Court, Bexar County, Texas, Case\n No. 98-CI-15220.&nbsp; This case did not involve an intersex issue but\n instead involved an individual who as an adult had surgery to transform\n themselves from a man to the physical characteristics of a woman.&nbsp; As\n a woman Ms. Littleton married Jonathan Littleton where they lived as husband\n and wife for seven (7) years.&nbsp; Jonathon Littleton died in 1996 allegedly\n as a result of malpractice of his treating physician.&nbsp; Ms. Littleton\n attempted to file an action under the Texas Wrongful Death Statute as a\n surviving spouse.&nbsp; The Defendant�s alleged that since Mrs. Littleton\n was in fact born a man and Texas did not recognize same sex marriages that\n she did not have standing to bring the action under the Wrongful Death\n Statute.&nbsp; The Trial Court agreed, granting Summary Judgment, and the\n issue was affirmed on appeal.&nbsp; Despite the fact that Christy Littleton\n had her birth certificate changed to reflect her as a female, the Texas\n Court looked beyond the ministerial act of the change of a birth certificate\n and found that since she was born a male she was unable to bring the action.&nbsp; </span></p>\n 

<span\nstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>There are also a series of cases that discuss whether\n transsexuals are in fact capable of marrying members of the same sex as\n defined at the time of their birth.&nbsp; There are some conflicting cases\n which may be more properly based upon that states a set of individual laws.&nbsp; These\n cases include <u>Baehr v. Lewin</u>, 852 P.2d 44 (Hawaii, abbr. 1993); <u>MT\n v. JT</u>, 355 A. 2d 204 Superior Court of New Jersey (1976); and <u>In\n re: Ladrach</u>, 513 N.E.2d 828 (Ohio, 1987); <u>Anonymous v.

(1973).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>\n 

<span\nstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>Several of these cases have been discussed in various\n Law Review articles.&nbsp; They would include an article titled �Sex Changes\n and Opposite Sex Marriages: Apply the Full Faith and Credit Clause to Comply\n Interstate Recognition of Transgendered Persons Amended Legal Sex for Marital\n Purposes.� 38 San Diego Law Review 1113 Fall, 2001 and �The Transsexual\n and the Damage Done: The Fourth Court of Appeals Opens Pandora�s Box by\n Closing the Door on Transsexuals Right to Marry.� 9 Law in Sex No. 1, 199-2000.&nbsp; </span>\n

# **D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conclusion**\n <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>While there presently exists a great deal of concern\n for the well-being of&nbsp; the individuals involved and the professionals\n continue to search for the answers, the focus for the health care professionals\n seem to have two rather clear pathways.&nbsp; The first is the pathway of\n inquiry and testing designed to determine whether or not the majority of\n persons treated by early surgical intervention derived a benefit or a harm\n from the surgery.&nbsp; At the present time it appears that there is a good\n faith effort on-going to arrive at sound conclusions in this regard.</p>\n <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The parallel path is the path of the health care\n professional who is proceeding in accordance with the well established standard\n of care for surgical treatment of these individuals within the first year\n of their life.&nbsp; While these two paths may appear to be inconsistent\n with one another, in reality they may both be standard of care, if the standard\n is defined as such by the medical community.&nbsp; While it is certainly\n logical to assume that the standard of care cannot or should not be changed\n until the results of the on-going studies are known there does none the less\n arise a concern that the results may differ from the traditional recommendation\n course of action.&nbsp; As such perhaps the only prudent way to proceed is\n to outline to the decision-maker the present state of medicine and its potential\n evolution.&nbsp; Only in this manner can a reasonably prudent health care\n practitioner proceed with either treatment or delay with any degree of comfort.&nbsp; Because\n of this scenario a traditional Consent Form may not be legally adequate.&nbsp; It\n is recommended that a Consent Form contain not only the traditional risks\n of surgery and anesthesia but should include the potential future mental\n or emotional component in the event the chosen sex becomes inappropriate.&nbsp; In\n this regard there is attached as an addendum hereto a proposed Consent Form\n for treatment.&nbsp; It is hoped that either this Consent or one revised\n in accordance with the wishes of the participants herein becomes utilized. </p>\n <br clear=ALL style='page-break-before:always'>\n <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=center style='text-align:center'><span\nstyle='font-size:14.0pt'>
