  <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under<br> Florida law, unless there is a judicial decree to the contrary, the decision-maker<br> for a minor�s health care decisions are the minor�s natural parents.&nbsp; A �minor� is<br> defined by Florida Statute as �any person who has not attained the age<br> of 18 years.�&nbsp; � 1.01(13), Fla. Stat. (2001).&nbsp; A natural parent<br> has the right to the custody of his or her child absent conduct or conditions<br> that justify a deprivation of the right in the interest of the welfare<br> of the child and such a legal right should not be lightly regarded.&nbsp; <u>Torres<br> v. Van Eepoel</u>, 98 So.2d 735 (Fla. 1958).&nbsp; The right to consent<br> to medical treatment will typically reside in the parents who have the<br> legal responsibility to maintain and support their child.&nbsp; <u>O�Keefe<br> v. Orea</u>, 731 So.2d 680 (Fla. 1st <span class="caps">DCA</span> 1998). Although the parents� right<br> to determine their child�s health care decisions is not absolute and there<br> is some judicial authority to override the parents� authority, the courts<br> have repeatedly held that it is the parents and their medical advisors<br> that generally must make these decisions.&nbsp; <u>In re Guardianship of<br> Barry</u>, 445 So.2d 365 (Fla. 2d <span class="caps">DCA</span> 1984).&nbsp; The love and affection<br> of another person, no matter how great, is insufficient to deprive a fit<br> and proper parent of the decision-making authority over his or her child.&nbsp; <u>Modacsi<br> v. Taylor</u>, 104 So.2d 664 (Fla. 1st <span class="caps">DCA</span> 1958).&nbsp; In situations where<br> there has been an adoption or a dissolution of marriage, the judicial decree<br> will typically assign the decision-making authority to the adoptive parents<br> or custodial parent.&nbsp; <u>See generally</u> Ch. 61, 63, Fla.

State, Dept.<br> of Health and Rehabilitative Services</u>, 462 So.2d 1160 (Fla. 2d <span class="caps">DCA</span> 1984).&nbsp; Medical<br> care may also be furnished in the absence of parental consent if the parents<br> have refused to give permission because of religious beliefs.&nbsp; <u>J.V.<br> v.

<p style='text-align:justify;<br>'>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In <u>M.N.</u>, the parents challenged an �order<br> by which medical treatment was authorized for their eight-month old child<br> B.N., without their consent.�&nbsp; <u>M.N.</u>, 648 So.2d at 770.&nbsp; The<br> child was admitted by the parents at the hospital, where she was diagnosed<br> with acute monocytic leukemia, severe anemia and a low platelet count.&nbsp; Chemotherapy<br> was then recommended as the most appropriate treatment for the child�s<br> life-threatening condition, which necessitated blood transfusions.&nbsp; The<br> parents refused to consent to this procedure based on their religious beliefs.&nbsp; <u>M.N.</u>,<br> 648 So.2d at 770.&nbsp; The hospital filed an emergency petition requesting<br> an order as to whether chemotherapy and blood transfusions might be administered<br> to the child without parental consent.&nbsp; In addition to their religious<br> objections, the parents expressed concern that the proposed medical treatment<br> would cause undue suffering to their child.&nbsp; After an evidentiary<br> hearing, the trial judge entered an order authorizing the proposed medical<br> treatment.&nbsp; <u>M.N.</u>, 648 So.2d at 770.&nbsp; The parents then<br> appealed the order to the First District Court of Appeal.&nbsp; </span>
</p><br> <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The First District then stated the law to be applied<br> setting out the obligations of the trial court in applying the law.&nbsp; </p><br> 

<p style='<br>text-align:justify;'>
  <span<br>style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; Ordinarily, decisions regarding the care and<br> upbringing of minor children will be left to the parents.&nbsp; This parent-child<br> relationship is a fundamental liberty interest which is constitutionally<br> protected.&nbsp; <u>Padgett v. Department of Health and Rehabil-itative<br> Services</u>, 577 So.2d 565 (Fla.1991); <u>In Re R.W.</u>, 495 So.2d 133<br> (Fla.1986); <u>see</u> <u>In Re Dubreuil</u>, 629 So.2d 819, 827 n. 11<br> (Fla.1993).&nbsp; But the parents&#8217; rights are not absolute, as the state<br> has parens patriae authority to ensure that children receive reasonable<br> medical treatment which is necessary for the preservation of life.&nbsp; <u>J.V.<br> v. State</u>, 516 So.2d 1133 (Fla. 1st <span class="caps">DCA</span> 1987).&nbsp; And as between<br> parent and child, the ultimate welfare of the child is the controlling<br> factor.&nbsp; <u>State v. Reeves</u>, 97 So.2d 18 (Fla.1957).&nbsp; Indeed,<br> the policy of advancing the best interests of the child is well rooted<br> in this state and guides the courts in many diverse contexts.&nbsp; <u>See,<br> e.g.</u>, <u>Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services v. Privette</u>,<br> 617 So.2d 305 (Fla.<b> </b></span><span<br>style='font-size:12.0pt'>1993); <u>Padgett; Dinkel v. Dinkel</u>, 322 So.2d 22<br> (Fla.1975).</span>

<p style='<br>text-align:justify;'>
  <span<br>style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; The state may override the fundamental liberty<br> interest in the parent-child relationship only when there is a sufficiently<br> compelling state interest.&nbsp; <u>In Re Guardianship of Browning</u>,<br> 568 So.2d 4 (Fla.1990); <u>Dubreuil</u>.&nbsp; Furthermore, the state&#8217;s<br> action must be narrowly tailored so as to produce the least intrusive interference<br> with individual rights, although the preservation of life has been described<br> as the most significant state interest.&nbsp; <u>Browning</u>.&nbsp; As<br> with the parent-child relationship, the state&#8217;s <i>parens patriae</i></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> authority<br> is thus not entirely unfettered.&nbsp; Rather, the state&#8217;s interest diminishes<br> as the severity of an affliction and the likelihood of death increase:</span>
</p><br> 

<p style='<br>text-align:justify;'>
  <span<br>style='font-size:12.0pt'>[T]here is a substantial distinction in the State&#8217;s<br> insistence that human life be saved where the affliction is curable, as<br> opposed to the State interest where &#8230; the issue is not whether, but when,<br> for how long and at what cost to the individual &#8230; life may be briefly<br> extended.</span>

</p><br> 

<p style='<br>text-align:justify;'>
  <span<br>style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; The constitutional right of privacy may afford<br> an individual suffering from a terminal illness the right to refuse medical<br> treatment. <u>Satz v.

Wons</u>, 541 So.2d 96 (Fla.1989).&nbsp; This<br> right has been extended to incompetent persons and to infants.&nbsp; <u>John<br> F. Kennedy Hosp.</u>; <u>Barry</u>.&nbsp; As Barry indicates, courts sometimes<br> rely on the doctrine of substituted judgment in effectuating the privacy<br> right of incompetent patients.&nbsp; Under this doctrine the court attempts<br> to ascertain the choice which would have been made by the patient, if competent.&nbsp; However, <u>Barry</u> recognizes<br> the inherent difficulty in applying this concept to young children.</span>
</p><br> 

<p style='<br>text-align:justify;'>
  <span<br>style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; There is no brightline rule or presumption that<br> applies to the dispute here at issue.&nbsp; An illustrative listing of<br> cases addressing this problem can be found in <u>Newmark v. Williams</u>,<br> 588 A.2d 1108 (Del. 1991).&nbsp; But the courts must carefully consider<br> the facts and circumstances of each individual case as it arises, in weighing<br> the various competing interests.&nbsp; Medical treatment may thus be rejected<br> when the evidence is not sufficiently compelling to establish the primacy<br> of the state&#8217;s interest, or that the child&#8217;s own welfare would be best<br> served by such treatment.&nbsp; <u>See</u> <u>Barry</u>; <u>Newmark</u>.&nbsp; On<br> the other hand, the parents&#8217; wishes may be overcome when there is sufficient<br> medical evidence to invoke the state&#8217;s parens patriae authority, and to<br> establish that the child&#8217;s welfare will be best served by the disputed<br> treatment.&nbsp; <u>See, e.g.</u>, <u>In Re Cabrera</u>, 381 Pa.Super.<br> 100, 552 A.2d 1114 (1989); <u>In Re Wilmann</u>, 24 Ohio App.3d 191, 493<br> N.E.2d 1380 (1986); <u>In Re Hamilton</u>, 657 S.W.2d 425 (Tenn.App.1983); <u>Custody<br> of a Minor</u>, 375 Mass. 733, 379 N.E.2d 1053 (1978).</span>

<p style='text-align:justify;<br>'>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The First District then concluded that �in the<br> present case it is not entirely clear whether the court fully considered<br> all of the competing interests involved.�&nbsp; <u>M.N.</u>, 648 So.2d<br> at 771.&nbsp; �Given the nature of this dispute, we conclude that the matter<br> should be remanded so as to ensure a balanced weighing of the various interests.�&nbsp; <u>M.N.</u>,<br> 648 So.2d at 771.&nbsp; �This necessitates [the] consideration of the parents� interest<br> in making fundamental decisions regarding the care of their child, the<br> state&#8217;s interest in preserving human life, and the child&#8217;s own welfare<br> and best interests, in light of the severity of the child&#8217;s illness, the<br> likelihood as to whether the proposed treatment will be effective, the<br> child&#8217;s chances of survival with and without such treatment, and the invasiveness<br> and nature of the treatment with regard to its effect on the child.�&nbsp; <u>M.N.</u>,<br> 648 So.2d at 771.&nbsp; Accordingly, it remanded the case to the trial<br> court for a further evidentiary hearing on these issues.&nbsp; <u>M.N.</u>,<br> 648 So.2d at 772.&nbsp; In view of the considerations set out by the First<br> District, and the past history of the Florida courts in these types of<br> cases, it appears quite evident that the majority of trial judges will<br> authorize the medical treatment for minors in such circumstances.&nbsp; </span>

St. Mary&#8217;s Hospital, Inc.</u>, 678 So.2d 455 (Fla. 4th <span class="caps">DCA</span> 1996).&nbsp; Nevertheless,<br> in the case of <u>M.N.</u>, the hospital successfully brought a petition<br> against the parents.&nbsp; If the health care provider does not have standing,<br> the issue then becomes who does have standing.&nbsp; The answer to this question<br> may lie in Rule 5.900, Florida Probate Rules.&nbsp; </p><br>

<p style='text-align:justify;<br>'>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>In 1989, the Second District Court<br> of Appeal issued a lengthy decision describing in dicta a method for judicial<br> review of a surrogate�s decision regarding the substituted judgment of<br> an incapacitated elderly patient.&nbsp; <u>In re Guardianship of Browning</u>,<br> 543 So.2d 258 (Fla. 2d <span class="caps">DCA</span> 1989).&nbsp; After the Florida Supreme Court<br> reviewed the Second District�s decision, it realized the importance of<br> creating an expedited judicial procedure for these types of decisions and<br> requested the Probate Rules Committee to submit to it a proposed rule.&nbsp; <u>In<br> re Guardianship of Browning</u>, 568 So.2d 4 n. 17 (Fla. 1990).&nbsp; In<br> 1991, the court created Rule 5.900, Florida Probate Rules, to assist this<br> legal procedure.&nbsp; Rule 5.900, on its face, is not limited to situations<br> involving elderly patients and appears to apply to all cases involving<br> expedited judicial intervention concerning medical treatment procedures.&nbsp; It<br> allows any �interested person� to file a petition.&nbsp; Rule 5.900 cautions<br> attorneys to �note that the criteria and standards of proof contained in <u>Browning</u> differ<br> from the criteria and standards of proof presently existing in chapter<br> 765, Florida Statutes.�&nbsp; Fla.Prob.R. 5.900.&nbsp; Accordingly, a careful<br> review of Rule 5.900 is critical.&nbsp; </span>

</p><br> <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>

**A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction**</p><br> <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>The legal doctrine of informed consent is well<br> accepted in the health care profession and the law.&nbsp; By now, generally<br> limited by only their own financial constraints and resources, almost all<br> patients understand that they have the right to make their health care decisions.&nbsp; This<br> right, of course, exists even if the patients� health care provider knows<br> better.&nbsp; As set out above, in the case of a minor, the minor�s parents<br> typically make the minor�s health care decisions.&nbsp; In the case of an<br> incompetent person, a guardian or surrogate or proxy makes the health care<br> decisions after determining what health care is in the best interest of the<br> incompetent person.&nbsp; The right to make a health care decision, of course,<br> rests upon an informed basis for the decision, hence the term �informed consent.�&nbsp; Informed<br> consent has been enumerated in several different sources of law, including<br> the federal constitution, state constitutions, federal statutes, state statutes,<br> and of course, the common law.&nbsp; As a general rule, a health care provider<br> must obtain the informed consent of a patient for treating, examining, or<br> operating on that individual.&nbsp; � 766.103(3), Fla. Stat. (2001).&nbsp; A<br> failure to do so may result in liability for negligent treatment.&nbsp; An<br> exception exists for emergency medical treatment that falls within the �Good<br> Samaritan Act.�&nbsp; � 768.13, Fla. Stat. (2001).&nbsp; </p><br>

  <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In <span style='color:black'><u>Cruzan v. Director,<br> Missouri Department of Health</u>, 497 U.S. 261, 110 S.Ct. 2841, 111<br> L.Ed.2d 224 (1990), the United States Supreme Court made clear that �a<br> competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest<br> in refusing unwanted medical treatment.�&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>, 497 U.S.<br> at 278.&nbsp; �This notion of bodily integrity has been embodied in<br> the requirement that informed consent is generally required for medical<br> treatment.�&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>, 497 U.S. at 269.&nbsp; �The informed<br> consent doctrine has become firmly entrenched in American tort law.&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>,<br> 497 U.S. at 269.&nbsp; �The logical corollary of the doctrine of informed<br> consent is that the patient generally possesses the right not to consent,<br> that is, to refuse treatment.�&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>, 497 U.S. at 270.&nbsp; Although <u>Cruzan</u> involved<br> the right to refuse life-sustaining treatment issue due to �the advance<br> of medical technology capable of sustaining life well past the point<br> where natural forces would have brought certain death in earlier times,� <u>Cruzan</u>,<br> 497 U.S. at 270, its holding on informed consent applies with equal<br> force to any issue involving informed consent.&nbsp; In fact, most<br> of the early cases that discussed informed consent involved the right<br> to refuse medical treatment based upon a patient�s religious beliefs.&nbsp; When<br> the courts base decisions on the federal constitution, it typically<br> means that the federal government or a state government has enacted<br> a statute that encroached upon or limits a patient�s right to consent<br> to a health care procedure or treatment or the right to receive information<br> in order to make an informed consent.&nbsp; </span></span>
</p><br> 

<p style='text-align:justify;<br>'>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>�But determining that a person has<br> a �liberty interest� under the Due Process Clause does not end the inquiry.�&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>,<br> 497 U.S. at 279.&nbsp; Rather, the issue of �whether [a person�s] constitutional<br> rights have been violated must be determined by balancing his liberty interests<br> against the relevant state interests.�&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>, 497 U.S. at<br> 270.&nbsp; Thus, although a competent person may have the right to refuse<br> unwanted medical treatment, the Supreme Court recognized that there are<br> situations where that liberty right may not be violated by a state that<br> prohibits the exercise of that right under certain circumstances.&nbsp; The<br> Supreme Court then reviewed the factual circumstances involving Ms. Cruzan,<br> an incompetent, where Missouri had a statute that �requires that evidence<br> of the incompetent�s wishes as to the withdrawal of treatment be proved<br> by clear and convincing evidence.�&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>, 497 U.S. at 280.&nbsp; �The<br> question, then, is whether the United States Constitution forbids the establishment<br> of this procedural requirement by the State.�&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>, 497<br> U.S. at 280.&nbsp; The Supreme Court held that it did not.&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>,<br> 497 U.S. at 280.&nbsp; </span>

<p style='<br>text-align:justify;'>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; Petitioners go on<br> to assert that an incompetent person should possess the same right in this<br> respect as is possessed by a competent person. . . . The difficulty with<br> petitioners&#8217; claim is that in a sense it begs the question:&nbsp; An incompetent<br> person is not able to make an informed and voluntary choice to exercise<br> a hypothetical right to refuse treatment or any other right.&nbsp; Such<br> a "right" must be exercised for her, if at all, by some sort<br> of surrogate.&nbsp; Here, Missouri has in effect recognized that under<br> certain circumstances a surrogate may act for the patient in electing to<br> have hydration and nutrition withdrawn in such a way as to cause death,<br> but it has established a procedural safeguard to assure that the action<br> of the surrogate conforms as best it may to the wishes expressed by the<br> patient while competent.&nbsp; Missouri requires that evidence of the incompetent&#8217;s<br> wishes as to the withdrawal of treatment be proved by clear and convincing<br> evidence.&nbsp; The question, then, is whether the United States Constitution<br> forbids the establishment of this procedural requirement by the State.&nbsp;&nbsp; We<br> hold that it does not.</span>
</p><br> 

<p style='<br>text-align:justify;'>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; Whether or not Missouri&#8217;s<br> clear and convincing evidence requirement comports with the United States<br> Constitution depends in part on what interests the State may properly seek<br> to protect in this situation.&nbsp; Missouri relies on its interest in<br> the protection and preservation of human life, and there can be no gainsaying<br> this interest.&nbsp; As a general matter, the States&#8212;indeed, all civilized<br> nations&#8212;demonstrate their commitment to life by treating homicide as a<br> serious crime.&nbsp; Moreover, the majority of States in this country have<br> laws imposing criminal penalties on one who assists another to commit suicide.&nbsp; We<br> do not think a State is required to re-main neutral in the face of an informed<br> and voluntary decision by a physically able adult to starve to death.</span>
</p><br> 

<p style='<br>text-align:justify;'>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; But in the context<br> presented here, a State has more particular interests at stake.&nbsp; The<br> choice between life and death is a deeply personal decision of obvious<br> and overwhelming finality.&nbsp; We believe Missouri<b> </b></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>may<br> legitimately seek to safeguard the personal element of this choice through<br> the imposition of heightened evident-iary requirements.&nbsp; It cannot<br> be disputed that the Due Process Clause protects an interest in life as<br> well as an interest in refusing life-sustaining medical treatment.&nbsp; Not<br> all incompetent patients will have loved ones available to serve as surrogate<br> decision-makers.&nbsp; And even where family members are present, "[t]here<br> will, of course, be some unfortunate situations in which family members<br> will not act to protect a patient."<i>&nbsp; </i></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><u>In<br> re Jobes</u><i>,</i></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> 108 N.J. 394,<br> 419, 529 A.2d 434, 447 (1987).&nbsp; A State is entitled to guard against<br> potential abuses in such situations.&nbsp; Similarly, a State is entitled<br> to consider that a judicial proceeding to make a determination regarding<br> an incompetent&#8217;s wishes may very well not be an adversarial one, with the<br> added guarantee of accurate factfinding that the adversary process brings<br> with it.&nbsp; <u>See</u><i> </i></span><span<br>style='font-size:12.0pt'><u>Ohio v.

  <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; We think it self-evident<br> that the interests at stake in the instant proceedings are more substantial,<br> both on an individual and societal level, than those involved in a run-of-the-mine<br> civil dispute.&nbsp; But not only does the standard of proof reflect the<br> importance of a particular adjudication, it also serves as "a societal<br> judgment about how the risk of error should be distributed between the<br> litigants."&nbsp; <u>Santosky</u>, <u>supra</u>, 455 U.S. at 755,<br> 102 S.Ct., at 1395; <u>Addington</u>, <u>supra</u>, 441 U.S., at 423, 99<br> S.Ct., at 1807-1808.&nbsp; The more stringent the burden of proof a party<br> must bear, the more that party bears the risk of an erroneous decision.&nbsp; We<br> believe that Missouri may permissibly place an increased risk of an erroneous<br> decision on those seeking to terminate an incompetent individual&#8217;s life-sustaining<br> treatment.&nbsp; An erroneous decision not to terminate results in a maintenance<br> of the status quo; the possibility of subsequent developments such as advancements<br> in medical science, the discovery of new evidence regarding the patient&#8217;s<br> intent, changes in the law, or simply the unexpected death of the patient<br> despite the administration of life-sustaining treatment at least create<br> the potential that a wrong decision will eventually be corrected or its<br> impact mitigated.&nbsp; An erroneous decision to with-draw life-sustaining<br> treatment, however, is not susceptible of correction.&nbsp; </span>

  <span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>Significantly, in addition to the<br> clear and convincing evidence standard, the United States Supreme Court<br> also held that states are not constitutionally required to accept the �substituted<br> judgment� of a patient�s close family member absent substantial proof that<br> their views reflected the views of the incompetent patient.&nbsp; <u>Cruzan</u>,<br> 497 U.S. at 286.&nbsp; </span>
</p><br> <p class=MsoBlockText>&nbsp; It is also worth noting that most, if not all,<br> States simply forbid oral testimony entirely in determining the wishes of<br> parties in transactions which, while important, simply do not have the consequences<br> that a decision to terminate a person&#8217;s life does.&nbsp; At common law and<br> by statute in most States, the parol evidence rule prevents the variations<br> of the terms of a written contract by oral testimony.&nbsp; The statute of<br> frauds makes unenforceable oral contracts to leave property by will, and<br> statutes regulating the making of wills universally require that those instruments<br> be in writing.&nbsp; 

<u>See</u> 2 A. Corbin, Contracts � 398, pp. 360-361<br> (1950); 2 W. Page, Law of Wills �� 19.3- 19.5, pp. 61-71 (1960).&nbsp; There<br> is no doubt that statutes requiring wills to be in writing, and statutes<br> of frauds which require that a contract to make a will be in writing, on<br> occasion frustrate the effectuation of the intent of a particular decedent,<br> just as Missouri&#8217;s requirement of proof in this case may have frustrated<br> the effectuation of the not-fully-expressed desires of Nancy Cruzan.&nbsp; But<br> the Constitution does not require general rules to work faultlessly; no general<br> rule can.</p><br>

</p><br> <p class=MsoBodyText3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Separate<br> from the United States Constitution, the Florida Supreme Court has recognized<br> that the Florida Constitution �guarantees that �a competent person has the<br> constitutional right to choose or refuse medical treatment, and that right<br> extends to all relevant decisions concerning one�s health.��&nbsp; 

<u>In<br> re Dubreuil</u>, 629 So.2d 819, 822 (Fla. 1993); <u>In re Guardianship of<br> Browning</u>, 568 So.2d 4, 11 (Fla. 1990); <u>Public Health Trust of Dade<br> County v. Wons</u>, 541 So.2d 96 (Fla. 1989).&nbsp; The Florida Supreme Court<br> premised this right upon a person�s right to privacy under Article I, section<br> 23, of the Florida Constitution.&nbsp; It recognized, however, that where<br> the issue involves a blood transfusion, the privacy right �overlaps with<br> the right to freely exercise one�s religion.�&nbsp; <u>In re Dubreuil</u>,<br> 629 So.2d at 822.&nbsp; In a prior decision, the court held that a terminally<br> ill incompetent person�s right to refuse medical treatment is the same as<br> a competent person�s right to refuse medical treatment.&nbsp; <u>John F.<br> Kennedy Memorial Hospital, Inc. v. Bludworth</u>, 452 So.2d 921 (Fla. 1984).&nbsp; In<br> so doing, the court recognized the doctrine of �substituted judgment� under<br> certain circumstances.&nbsp; <u>Bludworth</u>.&nbsp; Should there be any<br> doubt in the determination of the patient�s wishes about living or dying,<br> the default position favors life.&nbsp; <u>In re Guardianship of Schiavo</u>,<br> 780 So.2d 176 (Fla. 2d <span class="caps">DCA</span> 2001).&nbsp; </p><br> <p class=MsoBodyText2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps<br> the most controversial of the right to refuse medical treatment cases are<br> the ones where the patient refuses blood transfusions based upon religious<br> reasons.&nbsp; <u>In re Dubreuil</u>, <u>Wons</u>, <span style='color:black'><u>Harrell<br> v.

This appears to be based upon the initial research<br> and opinions set forth by Dr. John Money.&nbsp; Additionally, support for<br> early intervention has been set forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics<br> in a policy statement issued April 1996.&nbsp; American Academy of Pediatrics<br> Volume 97, Number 4, April 1996.&nbsp; In the policy statement, the academy<br> recommended surgery for orchidopexy and hypospadias to be performed between<br> six and 12 months of age.&nbsp; This policy statement helps define the<br> standard of care with respect to the timing of elective surgery on the<br> genitalia of children born with genital abnormalities.&nbsp; It should<br> be noted that the American Board of Pediatrics issued an addendum to their<br> 1996 position as published in Pediatrics 2000; 106:138-142.&nbsp; The Academy<br> stated �the 2000 policy on Developmental Anomalies of the External Genitalia<br> acknowledges the considerable recent debate about the appropriate general<br> assignment of newborns with the most extremes forms of genitalia ambiguity,<br> and notes that some have suggested that the current early surgical treatment<br> be abandoned in favor for allowing the affected person to participate in<br> gender assignment at a later time.�&nbsp; Recent studies and literature<br> suggests that there is an emerging issue with regard to the appropriate<br> timing of surgical intervention.&nbsp; As greater and more expansive studies<br> are undertaken, the standard of care with respect to the timing of surgical<br> intervention may in fact evolve.&nbsp; It is during this interim time period<br> that the practitioner faces a true gray area.&nbsp; </span></p><br> <p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify;line-height:<br>200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none;<br>font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

At the present time<br> however, this author has not located any legislature or court within the<br> United States that has directly addressed these issues and the responsibilities<br> of the healthcare practitioner with respect to them.&nbsp; There has been,<br> however, one case decided in Columbia that has considered the issues.</span></p><br> 

# **B.&nbsp; Columbia�s<br> Decision**<br> The Columbian Constitution Court issued two decisions.&nbsp; One<br> on May 12, 1999 and the other on August 2, 1999 which addressed issues<br> of surgical intervention in sexually ambiguous infants.&nbsp; The Court<br> found that �parents cannot give consent on a child�s behalf on surgeries<br> intended to determine sexual identity.�&nbsp; The Court indicated that<br> children older than five (5) years of age are the appropriate persons to<br> consent to surgeries to determine their sex.&nbsp; Additionally, in the<br> other Order the Court found the Informed Consent given to parents of a<br> child under the age of five (5) to be insufficient.&nbsp; At the present<br> time I have been unable to obtain an English translation of these decisions.&nbsp; Assuming,<br> however, that the English articles are accurate several questions come<br> immediately to mind.&nbsp; First, a comparison of the Constitution of Columbia<br> would need be compared to our own.&nbsp; There are perhaps some fundamental<br> differences which could have a bearing upon the basis of the decision.&nbsp; Secondly,<br> it is virtually impossible to imagine a scenario where a United States<br> Court would allow a minor to consent to a surgical procedure.&nbsp; As<br> stated previously in this article minors do not have the ability to enter<br> into a legally binding contract.&nbsp; Since a medical consent is in fact<br> a binding agreement minors would lack capacity to enter into it.&nbsp; One<br> final thought on the Columbia case centers on their displeasure with the<br> Informed Consent.&nbsp; As stated again it is likely that any decision<br> in the United States will turn upon the issue of Informed Consent.&nbsp; Therefore,<br> the issue that is presented in the Columbia case may be relevant to demonstrate<br> to healthcare professionals Courts general attitude towards an adequate<br> Informed Consent.&nbsp; </span></h2><br> 

# **C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Related Cases**<br> There are a number of related cases that although they<br> are not authoritative on the issues at hand are none the less illustrative<br> of the Court�s attitude towards a variety of issues respecting surgical<br> sex changes.&nbsp; I include the 

<u>Littleton v. Prange</u> case cited<br> in the 288<sup>th</sup> Judicial District Court, Bexar County, Texas, Case<br> No. 98-CI-15220.&nbsp; This case did not involve an intersex issue but<br> instead involved an individual who as an adult had surgery to transform<br> themselves from a man to the physical characteristics of a woman.&nbsp; As<br> a woman Ms. Littleton married Jonathan Littleton where they lived as husband<br> and wife for seven (7) years.&nbsp; Jonathon Littleton died in 1996 allegedly<br> as a result of malpractice of his treating physician.&nbsp; Ms. Littleton<br> attempted to file an action under the Texas Wrongful Death Statute as a<br> surviving spouse.&nbsp; The Defendant�s alleged that since Mrs. Littleton<br> was in fact born a man and Texas did not recognize same sex marriages that<br> she did not have standing to bring the action under the Wrongful Death<br> Statute.&nbsp; The Trial Court agreed, granting Summary Judgment, and the<br> issue was affirmed on appeal.&nbsp; Despite the fact that Christy Littleton<br> had her birth certificate changed to reflect her as a female, the Texas<br> Court looked beyond the ministerial act of the change of a birth certificate<br> and found that since she was born a male she was unable to bring the action.&nbsp; </span></p><br> 

<span<br>style='font-size:12.0pt'>There are also a series of cases that discuss whether<br> transsexuals are in fact capable of marrying members of the same sex as<br> defined at the time of their birth.&nbsp; There are some conflicting cases<br> which may be more properly based upon that states a set of individual laws.&nbsp; These<br> cases include <u>Baehr v. Lewin</u>, 852 P.2d 44 (Hawaii, abbr. 1993); <u>MT<br> v. JT</u>, 355 A. 2d 204 Superior Court of New Jersey (1976); and <u>In<br> re: Ladrach</u>, 513 N.E.2d 828 (Ohio, 1987); <u>Anonymous v.

# **D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conclusion**<br> <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>While there presently exists a great deal of concern<br> for the well-being of&nbsp; the individuals involved and the professionals<br> continue to search for the answers, the focus for the health care professionals<br> seem to have two rather clear pathways.&nbsp; The first is the pathway of<br> inquiry and testing designed to determine whether or not the majority of<br> persons treated by early surgical intervention derived a benefit or a harm<br> from the surgery.&nbsp; At the present time it appears that there is a good<br> faith effort on-going to arrive at sound conclusions in this regard.</p><br> <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The parallel path is the path of the health care<br> professional who is proceeding in accordance with the well established standard<br> of care for surgical treatment of these individuals within the first year<br> of their life.&nbsp; While these two paths may appear to be inconsistent<br> with one another, in reality they may both be standard of care, if the standard<br> is defined as such by the medical community.&nbsp; While it is certainly<br> logical to assume that the standard of care cannot or should not be changed<br> until the results of the on-going studies are known there does none the less<br> arise a concern that the results may differ from the traditional recommendation<br> course of action.&nbsp; As such perhaps the only prudent way to proceed is<br> to outline to the decision-maker the present state of medicine and its potential<br> evolution.&nbsp; Only in this manner can a reasonably prudent health care<br> practitioner proceed with either treatment or delay with any degree of comfort.&nbsp; Because<br> of this scenario a traditional Consent Form may not be legally adequate.&nbsp; It<br> is recommended that a Consent Form contain not only the traditional risks<br> of surgery and anesthesia but should include the potential future mental<br> or emotional component in the event the chosen sex becomes inappropriate.&nbsp; In<br> this regard there is attached as an addendum hereto a proposed Consent Form<br> for treatment.&nbsp; It is hoped that either this Consent or one revised<br> in accordance with the wishes of the participants herein becomes utilized. </p><br> <br clear=ALL style='page-break-before:always'><br> <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=center style='text-align:center'><span<br>style='font-size:14.0pt'>
