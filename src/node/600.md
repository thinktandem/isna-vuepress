Frader, J., P. Alderson, et al. (2004). &#8220;Health care professionals and intersex conditions.&#8221; _Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine_ 158: 424-8.\n\n&#8220;None of the appearance-altering surgeries need be done urgently.

(2004). &#8220;Reality vs recommendations in the care of infants with intersex conditions (invited critique).&#8221; _Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine_ 158: 428-9.\n\n&#8220;However, the . . . view that genital surgery be uniformly deferred until the patient is able to give consent cannot be supported by available information.&#8221;
