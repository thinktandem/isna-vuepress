# ISNA Establishes Medical Advisory Board;\n    Nation&#8217;s Top Experts to Provide Guidance and Support

  


The Intersex Society of North America is extremely pleased to announce the  
creation of a new Medical Advisory Board whose members will offer support  
and guidance in the pursuit of ISNA&#8217;s mission. The inaugural members,  
who will serve a two-year term, include some of the nation&#8217;s leading  
experts in pediatric endocrinology, urology, general pediatrics, nursing,  
psychiatry, psychology, social work, and bioethics. Dr. Vernon Rosario, Chair  
of the Medical Advisory Board and a member of ISNA&#8217;s Board of Directors,  
stated that &#8220;the MAB will help guide ISNA's increasingly succesful  
efforts to improve intersex treatment by promoting patient-centered care  
and by supporting research on functional outcomes of various approaches to  
treatment.&#8221; [Click [here][1] to see list of members.]

  


ISNA&#8217;s first decade has been remarkable for bringing a virtually invisible  
issue forward and challenging a tradition of under-informed and often damaging  
medical practice focused on creating the appearance of &#8220;normalcy.&#8221; Before  
ISNA, decisions about management of intersex conditions tended to be shrouded  
in secrecy and shame, and families faced with decision-making about intersex  
on behalf of their newborns had no sources of information beyond traditional,  
paternalistic medical practice and social prejudice. ISNA and courageous  
people with intersex conditions have opened up debate where before there  
was only silence, and have intelligently and compassionately developed  
and advocated for a patient-centered model of care.

  


Over the past ten years, ISNA has moved from &#8220;outsider&#8221; to &#8220;insider&#8221; in  
the medical community&#8211;our &#8220;reform paradigm&#8221; is now acknowledged  
by an important minority of doctors, while even those doctors who disagree  
with our program still work on a collegial basis with us. The Medical Advisory  
Board is an indication of just how much progress ISNA has made over the  
years in reshaping medical practices. Increasingly, we are working in partnership  
with health care professionals to improve treatment practices for intersex.

  


Guided by basic ethical principles, ISNA works to shift the focus of doctors  
toward the quality of life of their intersex patients as the measure  
of their success, and to encourage doctors to base their treatment on principles  
of  
openness and respect that underlie other types of medical care. We advocate  
for the following principles in understanding and treating intersex:

  


&#8226; Intersex is primarily a problem of shame and stigma, not of gender.  
  
&#8226; The child is the patient, not the parents.  
  
&#8226; Professional mental health care and peer support are essential.  
  
&#8226; Honest, complete disclosure is good medicine, consistent with the principles  
of contemporary medical ethics and law.  
  
&#8226; All children should be assigned male or female, without surgery, based  
on available evidence.  
  
&#8226;  
An individual&#8217;s sexual and reproductive integrity and autonomy  
should be protected.  
  
&#8226; A successful outcome is a person with a happy, fulfilling life.
