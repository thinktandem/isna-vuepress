---

\n 

The Intersex Society of North America is extremely pleased to announce the\n creation of a new Medical Advisory Board whose members will offer support\n and guidance in the pursuit of <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s mission. The inaugural members,\n who will serve a two-year term, include some of the nation&#8217;s leading\n experts in pediatric endocrinology, urology, general pediatrics, nursing,\n psychiatry, psychology, social work, and bioethics. Dr. Vernon Rosario, Chair\n of the Medical Advisory Board and a member of <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s Board of Directors,\n stated that &#8220;the <span class="caps">MAB</span> will help guide <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s increasingly succesful\n efforts to improve intersex treatment by promoting patient-centered care\n and by supporting research on functional outcomes of various approaches to\n treatment.&#8221; [Click [here][1] to see list of members.]\n 

<span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s first decade has been remarkable for bringing a virtually invisible\n issue forward and challenging a tradition of under-informed and often damaging\n medical practice focused on creating the appearance of &#8220;normalcy.&#8221; Before\n <span class="caps">ISNA</span>, decisions about management of intersex conditions tended to be shrouded\n in secrecy and shame, and families faced with decision-making about intersex\n on behalf of their newborns had no sources of information beyond traditional,\n paternalistic medical practice and social prejudice. <span class="caps">ISNA</span> and courageous\n people with intersex conditions have opened up debate where before there\n was only silence, and have intelligently and compassionately developed\n and advocated for a patient-centered model of care.\n 

Over the past ten years, <span class="caps">ISNA</span> has moved from &#8220;outsider&#8221; to &#8220;insider&#8221; in\n the medical community&#8211;our &#8220;reform paradigm&#8221; is now acknowledged\n by an important minority of doctors, while even those doctors who disagree\n with our program still work on a collegial basis with us. The Medical Advisory\n Board is an indication of just how much progress <span class="caps">ISNA</span> has made over the\n years in reshaping medical practices. Increasingly, we are working in partnership\n with health care professionals to improve treatment practices for intersex.\n 

Guided by basic ethical principles, <span class="caps">ISNA</span> works to shift the focus of doctors\n toward the quality of life of their intersex patients as the measure\n of their success, and to encourage doctors to base their treatment on principles\n of\n openness and respect that underlie other types of medical care. We advocate\n for the following principles in understanding and treating intersex:\n 

&#8226; Intersex is primarily a problem of shame and stigma, not of gender.  
\n&#8226; The child is the patient, not the parents.  
\n&#8226; Professional mental health care and peer support are essential.  
\n&#8226; Honest, complete disclosure is good medicine, consistent with the principles\n of contemporary medical ethics and law.  
\n&#8226; All children should be assigned male or female, without surgery, based\non available evidence.  
\n&#8226; \n An individual&#8217;s sexual and reproductive integrity and autonomy\n should be protected.  
\n&#8226; A successful outcome is a person with a happy, fulfilling life.\n
