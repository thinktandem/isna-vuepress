\nSummary:\n<p class=m2>\nAlice Dreger is a feminist historian of science and medicine who, at the urging of people born intersexed, became an activist for the reform of the social and medical treatment of intersex (atypical sex anatomies). When she started her activist work, she was shocked to find that, not only were academic feminists reluctant to help intersexed people, many actively supported the work of theorists like John Money whose work was the source of much oppression. This presentation introduces the audience to intersex and the intersex rights movement, and explores why it took so long for academic feminists to help stop what could fairly be termed &#8220;intersex genital mutilation&#8221; at home even while they worked tirelessly to end &#8220;female genital mutilation&#8221; in far-away places.\n</p>\n\n
