# East Hampton, New York: Vagina Monologues with The Missing Vagina Monologue

As part of the “V-Day Worldwide Campaign 2004”, the Long Island Lesbian Cancer Initiative (LILCI) has been granted the rights for a benefit reading of Eve Ensler’s award-winning play, “The Vagina Monologues”.  
  
The performance is at the John Frew Theatre at Guild Hall in East Hampton on Saturday, March 27th at 8pm with a special pre-performance by the New Century Singers at 7:30pm and a reception to follow at Rowdy Hall.  
  
A special presentation of Esther Morris' intersex monologue, [“The Missing Vagina Monologue”][1], will be featured at this reading and performed by Janet Green, co-founder of [Bodies Like Ours][2].  
  
Since its inception, V-Day’s campaign has used the arts as a vehicle for activism. Part of what makes this event so special is the opportunities it offers to our communities –- to participate in this global movement, to celebrate and honor the women and girls in your life and to be part of a collective voice.  
  
So come join us to raise money and awareness for LILCI's cultural competency education program and have a good time, for a good cause.
