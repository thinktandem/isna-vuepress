She&#8217;s coming to Boston this month!\n\nYou&#8217;ve probably heard of The Vagina Monologues. You may not know that\nthe book and play promotes the idea that clitorectomy occurs in\nAfrica, or perhaps a long time ago in America, but not here and now\n(page 66 in the V-Day edition). There&#8217;s also a dreadful line in the\nplay, in which a father tells his daughter, who was born without a\nvagina:\n\nbq. We&#8217;re gonna get you the best home made pussy in America.\nAnd when you meet your husband, he&#8217;ll know we had it made just for him! (page 99).\n\nAside from the implication that a woman&#8217;s body should be\nsurgically altered purely for the benefit of a hypothetical future\nhusband, this passage ignores the realities of what happens to a girl\nwhen doctors decide to &#8220;fix&#8221; her vagina.\n\n\nFirst, please take a moment to learn about these realities, in the\nfollowing personal narratives by Marguerite Morris and Angela Moreno:\n\n\nMorris, Marguerite. 2001. The Missing Vagina Monologue. Sojourner,\nMarch. Available from http://www.isna.org/library/missingvagina.html.\n\n\nMoreno, Angela. 1999. In Amerika They Call Us Hermaphrodites. In\nIntersex in the Age of Ethics, edited by A. D. Dreger. Hagerstown,\nMD: University Publishing Group. Available from\nhttp://www.libidomag.com/nakedbrunch/archive/hermaphrodites.html.\n\nNext, you should know that Boston is a major center for genital\nsurgeries on intersex infants, and that Eve Ensler will appear later\nthis week at an event where audience feedback is encouraged (details\nbelow). Please go to this event, and raise the issue of genital\nmutilation! Every performance of The Vagina Monologues contributes to\nthe invisibility of <span class="caps">IGM</span> (Intersex Genital Mutilation), and makes it\nthat much harder to stop.\n\n\nIf you are going to see The Vagina Monologues, print one of the above\narticles (or pick up the issue of Sojourner) and give it to the\nperson behind you in line!\n\n\nIf you belong to an online activist community, forward this email to\nthem, or point them to <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s website (which has a news story on the\nfront page about The Vagina Monologues).\n\n\nYours Truly,\n\n\nCheryl\n\n\nCheryl Chase\nIntersex Society of North America\nhttp://www.isna.org\n\n>A conversation with Eve Ensler hosted by Carol Gilligan:\n>Carol and Eve will discuss <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">VAGINA</span> <span class="caps">MONOLOGUES</span>, the V-<span class="caps">DAY</span> <span class="caps">MOVEMENT</span>,\n>and the general state of women&#8217;s <span class="caps">VAGINAS</span>.\n>\n>Monday, March 26 @ 7pm &#8212; <span class="caps">FREE</span>!\n>Simmons College Alumnae Hall (321 Brookline Ave., Boston)\n>\n>Even Ensler, the creator of The Vagina Monologues, the theatrical\n>phenomenon that&#8217;s changed women&#8217;s language, lives and love for our\n>bodies.\n>Carol Gilligan is a groundbreaking psychologist and author of In a\n>Different Voice, Between Voice and Silence and many other works.\n>\n>Audience feedback will be encouraged!\n>\n\n\n
