For a limited time, you can see a short film by intersex activists online. Your vote and comments can help them win the PlanetOut Movie Awards!  
<b class=dr>Borderline</b> is the trailer for a work in progress by Lisset Barcellos and Rafael Dumett. Lisett is herself intersexed, and her affidavit was an important element of ISNA's amicus brief to the Constitutional Court of Colombia, resulting in [historic human rights protections][3] for intersex children. See also "[La Verdad por Favor][4]," a letter from Lisset to her doctor. Four minutes.
