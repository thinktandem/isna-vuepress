title: "Editorial in British Medical Journal urges doctors to stand back and rethink"
---

<br>British Medical Journal has published an editorial in its December edition (2001; 323:1264-1265) that suggests that &#8220;it is time to stand back and rethink&#8221; the current treatment protocol of intersex children. Authors Sarah Creighton and Catherine Minto argued that more researches are necessary, citing the emergence of intersex patient groups such as <span class="caps">ISNA</span> as well as the recent studies that demonstrated negative impacts of surgical treatment. Criticizing the mundane practice of non-disclosure of information, the authors urge the medical community to treat patients within a multidisciplinary team and to collaborate with patient groups to create &#8220;a major research partnership.&#8221; See British Medical Journal&#8217;s [web site][1] for the full text of the editorial.<br>

<br><b class=dr>Update 12/15/2001:</b> <br>The web site of <span class="caps">BMJ</span> [published][2] a response from Melissa Cull, the founder of Adrenal Hyperplasia Network in England, to Creighton and Minto&#8217;s editorial. <br>
