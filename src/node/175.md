# AIS Support Group condemns vaginoplasty on infants and children

  
The AIS Support Group has taken a strong stand condemning vaginal surgery in infants and children. The group also questioned sex reassignment of children born with small penises, and clitoral surgery on girls born with large clitorises. (Read [AIS Support Group's statement][1])
