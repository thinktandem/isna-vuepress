<p>The <a href="http://www.dsdguidelines.org/htdocs/clinical/references.html">References Section</a> of <a href="http://www.dsdguidelines.org">Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Disorders of Sex Development in Childhood</a> is an excellent bibliographic resource, with many clickable links. Depending upon what you are looking for, this may be more manageable than the larger bibliography hosted here at <a href="http://www.isna.org/bibliographies"><span class="caps">ISNA</span></a>.</p>
