\n

\nIntersex Society of North America has a limited number of intersex activists/speakers who are willing to come to your campus and talk about issues intersex people face and how we are changing that. This is an ideal educational opportunity for your campus as part of the V-Day activities, Women&#8217;s History/Herstory Month, or other occasions. Generally, we ask for a fixed honorarium plus travel, lodging and food expenses to be paid by the sponsor(s), but special discounts may be available if one of our speakers happen to live in the same city as your school/organization, or if several schools/organizations in the same area request our speakers for the same week. If you are interested in having us come and speak at your campus, [please email us][1] for availability and specific conditions\n
