# Miki Ann Dimarco confined in isolation because she's intersexed

<p>The Casper Wyoming Star Tribune is carrying an article about Miki Ann Dimarco. Early this year, a U.S. District Court judge found that 438 days of confinement in Pod Three, a maximum security four-cell segregated area that is used to house the Wyoming Women&#8217;s Center worst inmates, was not cruel an unusual punishment. Dimarco was found guilty of passing six bad checks, totalling $742.85. That&#8217;s not why she was confined all alone for over a year. Rather, prison officials decided to segregate her when they discovered that she was intersexed.  </p>
