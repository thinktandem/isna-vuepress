for Intersex Children:  
  
A Sample Resolution

  
<p class=m2>  
WHEREAS, at least one in 2000 children is born with notably atypical sex anatomy; and  
</p><p class=m2>  
WHEREAS, these children are frequently subjected to repeated and medically unnecessary display to satisfy the curiosity of medical professionals; and  
</p><p class=m2>  
WHEREAS, intersex children are frequently subjected, before they are old enough to provide informed consent, to invasive surgical and hormonal procedures to make their bodies more closely approximate what doctors consider "normal"; and  
</p><p class=m2>  
WHEREAS, parents of intersex children are rarely given full and accurate information about the child's condition and risks involved in these procedures, or referrals to supportive information and resources; and  
</p><p class=m2>  
WHEREAS, intersex children and adults are frequently not given full and accurate information about their own condition and medical history; and  
</p><p class=m2>  
WHEREAS, many intersex people grow up feeling hurt, isolated and ashamed due to these violations of their bodily integrity and their systemic erasure;  
</p><p class=m2>  
WHEREAS, in recent years many intersex people have come forth to report that these medical interventions have been the source of physical, emotional, and sexual harm;  
</p><p class=m2>  
WHEREAS, legal and social assignment of sex do not require "normalizing" sexual surgeries; and  
</p><p class=m2>  
WHEREAS, since 1993 the Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) and other organizations have been formed by intersex people to end secrecy, shame and unwanted genital surgeries on children born with atypical sex anatomy;  
</p><p class=m2>  
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that ORGANIZATION supports the rights of children too young to consent to be free of unnecessary medical display and of cosmetic procedures including surgical and hormonal interventions which influence the sexual appearance of their bodies; and  
</p><p class=m2>  
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that ORGANIZATION supports the rights of people old enough to make an informed choice to choose procedures including surgical and hormonal interventions which influence the sexual appearance of their bodies; and  
</p><p class=m2>  
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that ORGANIZATION supports the leadership of ISNA and other intersex advocacy groups in their struggle to end secrecy, shame and unwanted genital surgeries on children except in cases where there are genuine health reasons requiring surgeries;  
</p><p class=m2>  
BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED that ORGANIZATION urges the medical community to establish and adopt a patient-centered treatment protocol in conjunction with patient advocacy groups under which patients are not made objects of curiosity, full and accurate information is disclosed and supportive resources and information, including referrals to support groups of adult intersex people, are provided to parents of intersex children.
