# Emi Koyama addresses the term DSD

<p>Intersex Activist <a href="http://intersexinitiative.org/">Emi Koyama</a> gave a keynote presentation at a conference in Vermont, in which she discussed the increasing use of the term &#8220;<span class="caps">DSD</span>&#8221; (disorders of sex development). You can read <a href="http://www.intersexinitiative.org/articles/intersextodsd.html">Emi&#8217;s talk here</a>.  </p>

<p>Emi points out that &#8220;<span class="caps">DSD</span>&#8221; can be useful because it has a much less negative sense for parents, and because it can build a common cause with disability activists.  </p>

<p>Please note that Emi writes from her own perspective, and does not represent <span class="caps">ISNA</span>.</p>
