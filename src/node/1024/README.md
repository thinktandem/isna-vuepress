# UK Researchers: A knack for asking good questions

<p>I&#8217;ve been updating my references database, and I continue to be impressed by the sophistication of the work coming from UK professionals on intersex issues. These articles are a great example.  </p>

<p>The Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group maintains an excellent web page detailing the <a href="http://www.medhelp.org/www/ais/53_STUDIES.HTM">various types of intersex research</a> underway. Be sure to have a look at <a href="http://www.medhelp.org/www/ais/53_STUDIES.HTM#Differing">Differing Agendas?</a>, their critique of the misguided focus of most of the research (&#8220;The main problem in <span class="caps">AIS</span>, as we see it, is a total lack of awareness by the medical profession of the problems involved in growing up with this condition.&#8221;)  </p>

<p>I think that the misguided focus on gender (as opposed to stigma and trauma, which are the most salient issues for most patients and families) is what prevents researchers from asking more clinically relevant questions. What&#8217;s really disappointing is that so many physicians dismiss the work of the London group as irrelevant. Here are two glaring examples:  </p>
