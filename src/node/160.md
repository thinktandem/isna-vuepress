<P>
  Common medical wisdom had it that "nerve-sparing" surgery could<br />preserve sexual function in most <BR /><br />men treated for prostate cancer. A study in the Aug 6, 1997 issue of Journal<br />of the National Cancer Institute reveals that in fact, the surgery is just<br />about as destructive of sexual function as the traditional surgery.
</P>

<br /><br />

<P>
  A Harvard Medical School team surveyed 37 beneficiaries of the "nerve-sparing"<br />surgery and 12 of the traditional surgery. All 12 of the latter group were<br />impotent a year after surgery. So, contrary to expectations, were 33 of<br />the 37 men who had the newer procedure.

<br /><br />

<P>
  These sorts of results ought to be in the forefront of our thinking when<br />considering the claims of&nbsp; physicians that current genital surgeries<br />are vastly improved over any of the surgeries performed on intersex people<br />old enough to voice a complaint. <BR /><br />&nbsp;
