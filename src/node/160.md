  Common medical wisdom had it that "nerve-sparing" surgery could\npreserve sexual function in most <BR />\nmen treated for prostate cancer. A study in the Aug 6, 1997 issue of Journal\nof the National Cancer Institute reveals that in fact, the surgery is just\nabout as destructive of sexual function as the traditional surgery.

<P>
  A Harvard Medical School team surveyed 37 beneficiaries of the "nerve-sparing"\nsurgery and 12 of the traditional surgery. All 12 of the latter group were\nimpotent a year after surgery. So, contrary to expectations, were 33 of\nthe 37 men who had the newer procedure.

  These sorts of results ought to be in the forefront of our thinking when\nconsidering the claims of&nbsp; physicians that current genital surgeries\nare vastly improved over any of the surgeries performed on intersex people\nold enough to voice a complaint. <BR />\n&nbsp;
