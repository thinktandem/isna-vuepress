For Immediate Release: February 5, 2003  
\n  
\n <span class="caps">SEATTLE</span>, WA &#8211; The Intersex Society of North America (<span class="caps">ISNA</span>), an \n advocacy and policy group for people with atypical genital and \n reproductive anatomies, has moved its office to Seattle, Washington \n from Petaluma, California.&nbsp; In addition, Dr. Vernon Rosario, \n a physician and medical historian, has joined the Board of Directors.\n 

"We hope to reach out to our many allies in the medical \n and bioethics communities in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest, \n as well as pursuing our social change agenda nationally and across \n North America," stated <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s Executive Director, Dr. Monica \n Casper, Ph.D." Among other initiatives, we will be launching \n an educational video that will offer the medical community a real \n alternative to unnecessary surgeries on babies with intersex conditions."\n 

Dr. Casper was referring to [First, \n Do No Harm: Total Patient Care for Intersex][1], a documentary \n film which presents a patient-centered approach to the health \n needs of people with intersex conditions.&nbsp; New evidence and \n advances in medical ethics have led to the need for revision in \n the standard of care for intersex. Critiquing current medical \n practices and exploring a more ethical and humane approach to \n treatment, the film is compelling, hard-hitting, and deeply moving.\n 

The video is currently [available \n for purchase][1] on <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s website&nbsp; and will be introduced \n this year to medical schools and medical institutions across the \n country. <span class="caps">ISNA</span> is releasing it in conjunction with a medical reform \n "package" that includes information about textbook revision, \n clinical guidelines for teaching intersex issues in medical schools, \n and a parent&#8217;s handbook.&nbsp; <span class="caps">ISNA</span> will also establish a national \n Medical Advisory Committee in 2003.\n 

Dr. Vernon Rosario&#8217;s addition to the Board of Directors will \n strengthen <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s ties to the medical community. A child psychiatrist \n in Los Angeles working in private practice and with <span class="caps">LGBTI</span> foster \n children, Dr. Rosario received his Ph.D. in the History of Science \n from Harvard University, and his M.D. from the Harvard Medical \n School&#8212;M.I.T. Program in Health Sciences and Technology.&nbsp; \n He is a widely published scholar whose&nbsp; current research \n focuses on transgender and intersex children and adolescents.\n
