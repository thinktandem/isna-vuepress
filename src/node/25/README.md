_Fresh Air_ on intersex

Terry Gross, host of the popular NPR program "Fresh Air," produced  
by WHYY in Philadelphia,  
  
interview intersex activist Cheryl Chase and pediatric surgeon Antoine Khoury  
and social  
  
worker Barbara Nielson, both of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.  
The program  
  
aired 11 December 1997.

Khoury largely dismissed the complaints of intersex activists, insisting  
that they must have had "bad surgery," and that surgery is now  
much improved. Nielson agreed with intersex activists that secrecy is harmful,  
citing her experience working with adopted children, but concluded that  
surgery was necessary before a child goes to day care, in order to forestall  
teasing by peers.
