Available from [http://www.findarticles.com/cf\_0/m1511/12\_21/67185294/p1/article.jhtml.][6] <br> <br> <p class=m2> An unfortunate indication of how far we still have <br> to go. Dr. Marion recently saw a teenage girl, who came to him <br> to ask about some physical issues that she shared with several <br> other members of her family, and which had always been quite mysterious <br> to her. Dr. Marion diagnosed her with androgen insensitivity syndrome, <br> but did not tell her this diagnosis. Although the patient was <br> kept in the dark, Dr. Marion published her story for the entertainment <br> of readers of 

_Discover_ Magazine. </p><br>

Gender Self-Reassignment in an XY Adolescent Female Born <br> With Ambiguous Genitalia. _Pediatrics_ 106:135-137. <br> <p class=m2> Yet another case in which doctors "assigned" <br> a boy female because they believed his penis "too small", <br> and the girl grew up to be a boy anyway. Authors call for open <br> disclosure to patients with intersex conditions and their parents, <br> and for a moratorium on early surgery. Unfortunately, the same <br> issue of the journal carries an announcement of a new policy by <br> the American Academy of Pediatrics which calls for continued surgeries <br> on infants, but fails to cite evidence to support that view. </p><br>
