Interview with Anne Fausto-Sterling, author of "[Sexing \n the Body][5]." Intersexuality is a major topic of the discussion. \n \n 

Marion, Robert. 2000. The Curse of the Garcias. _Discover_, \n December, 42-. Available from [http://www.findarticles.com/cf\_0/m1511/12\_21/67185294/p1/article.jhtml.][6] \n \n <p class=m2> An unfortunate indication of how far we still have \n to go. Dr. Marion recently saw a teenage girl, who came to him \n to ask about some physical issues that she shared with several \n other members of her family, and which had always been quite mysterious \n to her. Dr. Marion diagnosed her with androgen insensitivity syndrome, \n but did not tell her this diagnosis. Although the patient was \n kept in the dark, Dr. Marion published her story for the entertainment \n of readers of 

_Discover_ Magazine. </p>\n

Gender Self-Reassignment in an XY Adolescent Female Born \n With Ambiguous Genitalia. _Pediatrics_ 106:135-137. \n <p class=m2> Yet another case in which doctors "assigned" \n a boy female because they believed his penis "too small", \n and the girl grew up to be a boy anyway. Authors call for open \n disclosure to patients with intersex conditions and their parents, \n and for a moratorium on early surgery. Unfortunately, the same \n issue of the journal carries an announcement of a new policy by \n the American Academy of Pediatrics which calls for continued surgeries \n on infants, but fails to cite evidence to support that view. </p>\n

Nussbaum, Emily. 2000. A question of gender. _Discover_, \n January, 92-99. Available from [http://www.findarticles.com/cf\_0/m1511/1\_21/58398807/p1/article.jhtml][8]. \n \n <p class=m2> "A question of Gender," by Emily Nussbaum, \n is a sensitive examination of intersexuality and the controversy \n over treatment. Presents a family who are faced with making a \n tough decision about whether or not to have surgery performed \n on their child. Wonderful photographs of a loving family.

Review and synthesis.  _American Journal of \n Human Biology_ 12:151-166. \n <P calss=m2> Finally! Synthesized statistics on how common deviations \n from "standard" sex anatomy are.
