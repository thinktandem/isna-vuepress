<p class=m2> "Our main finding was that there was enormous  
variation between different health professionals in what they  
knew, thought, and told parents about specific sex chromosome  
anomalies. Health professionals from 7 of the 14 district general  
hospitals said that it was a matter of chance that they had been  
the one to inform parents of the result." </p>

as an escape from the psychological distress." </p>

Interview with Anne Fausto-Sterling, author of "[Sexing  
the Body][8]." Intersexuality is a major topic of the discussion.  


  


Marion, Robert. 2000. The Curse of the Garcias. _Discover_,  
December, 42-. Available from [http://www.findarticles.com/cf\_0/m1511/12\_21/67185294/p1/article.jhtml.][9]  


  
<p class=m2> An unfortunate indication of how far we still have  
to go. Dr. Marion recently saw a teenage girl, who came to him  
to ask about some physical issues that she shared with several  
other members of her family, and which had always been quite mysterious  
to her. Dr. Marion diagnosed her with androgen insensitivity syndrome,  
but did not tell her this diagnosis. Although the patient was  
kept in the dark, Dr. Marion published her story for the entertainment  
of readers of _Discover_ Magazine. </p>  


Coventry, Martha. 2000. Making the Cut. _Ms. Magazine_,  
October/November, 52-60. Available from <http://www.msmagazine.com/oct00/makingthecut.html>.  


  
<p class=m2> Finally! _Ms. Magazine_ acknowledges that clitorectomy  
continues in the U.S. </p>  


Matthews, Karen. 2000. Controversy Over Care for Infants With  
Ambiguous Genitals. _Associated Press_, October 19. 

  
<p class=m2> A very balanced article depicting intersex adults'  
criticism of medical management, which ran in many newspapers,  
large and small, across the country. </p>  


Phornphutkul, Chanika, Anne Fausto-Sterling, and Philip A. Gruppuso.  
2000. Gender Self-Reassignment in an XY Adolescent Female Born  
With Ambiguous Genitalia. _Pediatrics_ 106:135-137. 

  
<p class=m2> Yet another case in which doctors "assigned"  
a boy female because they believed his penis "too small",  
and the girl grew up to be a boy anyway. Authors call for open  
disclosure to patients with intersex conditions and their parents,  
and for a moratorium on early surgery. Unfortunately, the same  
issue of the journal carries an announcement of a new policy by  
the American Academy of Pediatrics which calls for continued surgeries  
on infants, but fails to cite evidence to support that view. </p>  


Wisniewski, Amy, Claude J. Migeon, Heino F. Meyer-Bahlburg,

Money. 2000. Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome: Long-Term  
Medical, Surgical, and Psychosexual Outcomes. _Journal of Clinical  
Endocrinology and Metabolism_ 85 (8):2664-2669. 

  
<p class=m2> Authors' investigation of 14 women with complete AIS  
supports the demands of patient advocacy groups for open disclosure,  
and avoidance of gonadectomy and vaginal surgery on children.

Ethical and Medical Dilemma: Should Physicians Perform Sex Assignment  
Surgery on Infants with Ambiguous Genitalia? _Michigan Journal  
of Gender and Law_ 7. 

  
<p class=m2> An important advance in legal attention to medical  
management of intersex. See our [legal  
page][10] for more info. </p>  


Lewis, Ricki. 2000. Reevaluating Sex Reassignment. _The Scientist_  
14 (14):6. Available from http://www.the-scientist.com/yr2000/jul/lewis\_p6\_000710.html.  


  
<p class=m2> A very confused article. </p>  


Levay, Simon. 2000. Male, Female, Other. _Nerve_. Available  
from http://www.nerve.com/LeVay/intersex/intersex.html.  


  
<p class=m2> Illustrates how, for intersex people, chromosomes often  
don't determine gender, by contrasting two intersex people, one  
a woman with XY and one a man with XX chromosomes. </p>  


Fausto-Sterling, Anne. 2000. The Five Sexes, Revisited. _The  
Sciences_, July/August, 18-23. Available from <http://www.nyas.org/membersonly/sciences/sci0007/fausto_body.html>.  


  
<p class=m2> An invaluable update on how the controversy over medical  
management of intersexuality has developed since Fausto-Sterling's  
original publication of The Five Sexes in The Sciences in 1993.  
</p>  


Nussbaum, Emily. 2000. A question of gender. _Discover_,  
January, 92-99. Available from [http://www.findarticles.com/cf\_0/m1511/1\_21/58398807/p1/article.jhtml][11].  


  
<p class=m2> "A question of Gender," by Emily Nussbaum,  
is a sensitive examination of intersexuality and the controversy  
over treatment. Presents a family who are faced with making a  
tough decision about whether or not to have surgery performed  
on their child. Wonderful photographs of a loving family. No eyes  
blacked out here! </p>  


Ward and Associates (2000). Is it a Boy or a Girl? Great Falls  
VA, _Discovery Channel_. 

  
<p class=m2> A one hour documentary on the burgeoning controversy  
over medicalization of children born with atypical sex characteristics.  
The U.S. premiere, March 26 on the Discovery Channel, garnered  
35% higher ratings than usual for that slot, despite little promotion  
and competition from the Academy Awards. Expect it to air again  
in a more favorable time slot later this year, perhaps August  
6th at 10PM. </p>  


Hegarty, Peter. and Cheryl Chase (2000). "Intersex Activism,  
Feminism, and Psychology: Opening a Dialogue on Theory, Research,  
and Clinical Practice." _Feminism & Psychology_  
 **10**: 117-132. 

  
<p class=m2> An edited transcript of a two hour discussion between  
psychologist Peter Hegarty and ISNA director Cheryl Chase. The  
discussion roams over Chase's personal experiences, and the relationships  
between intersex activism, feminism, lesbian and gay politics,  
and psychological theory and practice. </p>  


Davis, Ruth G. (2000). Was I Meant to Be a Man? _Cosmopolitan_.  
 **228:** 200-203. 

  
<p class=m2> Presents short biographies of four intersexed women,  
including a photograph of courageous Tammy Harwell, and provides  
the web addresses of  ISNA  
and  AIS-SG. </p>  


Blackless, Melanie, Anthony Charuvastra, Amanda Derryck, Anne  
Fausto-Sterling, Karl Lauzanne, and Ellen Lee. 2000. How sexually  
dimorphic are we? Review and synthesis.  _American Journal of  
Human Biology_ 12:151-166. 

  
<P calss=m2> Finally! Synthesized statistics on how common deviations  
from "standard" sex anatomy are. " We conclude  
that the frequency may be as high as 2% of live births. The frequency  
of individuals receiving 'corrective' genital surgery, however,  
probably runs between 1 and 2 per 1,000 live births (0.1% &shy;  
0.2%). </p>  


Dreger, Alice. 2000. Jarring bodies: Thoughts on the display  
of unusual anatomies.  _Perspectives in Biology and Medicine  
_ (Winter):161-172. 

  
<p class=m2> "Paradoxically, in the effort to train students  
and residents to alleviate the freakish feelings sometimes associated  
with unusual anatomies, people with unusual anatomies are examined,  
presented, and represented in ways that make them feel freakish."
