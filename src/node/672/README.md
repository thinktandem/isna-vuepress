# Piscataway, NJ: Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Intersex Panel

For many years the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School has been a leader in sex education for medical students. In 2005, their annual "Sex Week" will kick off with a panel discussion on intersex, featuring ISNA board members Debbie Hartman (mother of child with intersex) and Alice Dreger (scholar), co-founder of Bodies Like Ours Janet Green (woman with an intersex condition), and clinician David Sandberg, Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Buffalo. The panel will start at 8 a.m. on Monday, January 3, 2005, and is organized by psychologist Nina Williams, a member of ISNA's Medical Advisory Board and Adjunct Associate Professor at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.
