The next meeting of the Bay Area 47,XXY support group will take place on Thursday, October 20 from 7:00 – 9:00 p.m.  
  
  
  
Dr. Katie Farhner & Mr. Richard King from [The Sibling Center at CPMC][1] will discuss how to support the emotional, physical and psychosocial needs of the “well sibling”. The Sibling Center recognizes that when there is a child or adolescent with a medical condition in the family, parents often overlook the needs of the well brothers and sisters.  
  
  
  
Lindy Joffe, MS, OTR at the Child Development Center at CPMC will talk about Sensory Dysfunction. Her presentation will concentrate on identifying sensory dysfunction, examples of the therapies an occupational therapist may use to treat sensory dysfunction, and finding an OT trained in sensory integration.
