Frankle, R. E. (2003). &#8220;Does a marriage really need sex? A critical analysis of the gender restriction on marriage.&#8221; _Fordham Urban Law Journal_ <span class="caps">XXX</span>: 2007-37.\n\n&#8220;Limitations on marriage affect a greater number of people than is first evident.

Confining marriage to between two people of the opposite sex leads to problems deciding what an opposite sex couple is and who defines an opposite sex couple.&#8221;
