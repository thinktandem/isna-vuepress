The Sex That Dare Not Speak Its Name  
  
by Emily Nussbaum  
  
In Lingua Franca, May/June 99  
  
  
  
A long article by Emily Nussbaum in the current  
  
issue of Lingua Franca details the rise of the  
  
increasingly successful intersex social justice  
  
movement, its alliances with humanists and  
  
social scientists in the academy, and growing  
  
pockets of change within the medical  
  
community.  
  
  
  
  
  
EXCERPT FROM THE ARTICLE  
  
  
  
According to Philip Gruppuso, a professor of  
  
pediatrics and biochemistry at Brown  
  
University who has recently embraced ISNA's  
  
agenda, his colleagues intransigence is the  
  
result of basic medical conservatism mixed with  
  
a genuine emotional anxiety. "Whenever  
  
physicians are confronted with the fact that  
  
something that was standard is incorrect, you're  
  
forced to think about all the damage you did,"  
  
he explains. . . . But, Gruppuso worries that  
  
doctors are simply unwilling to grant expertise  
  
to academics in nonmedical disciplines, even  
  
when it would illuminate their own work. "We  
  
need to concede that we might be experts on  
  
the biology and science but not necessarily in  
  
psychology, sociology, and anthropology. I  
  
would hazard a guess that Suzanne Kessler  
  
[author of "Lessons from the Intersexed,"  
  
Rutgers 1998] knows more about these diseases  
  
than 95% of pediatricians."  
  
  
  
One of the most striking examples of a medical  
  
turnaround is Judson Van Wyk, Kenan Professor  
  
of Pediatrics at the University of North Carolina  
  
School of Medicine and the author of the classic  
  
textbook chapter "Disorders of Sex  
  
Differentiation" on the diagnosis and surgical  
  
treatment of intersexual infants. . . . Van Wyk is  
  
now opposed to many of the protocols he  
  
helped establish. In his earlier work, "I claimed  
  
that children should not be assigned male  
  
unless it is reasonable to expect an adult  
  
phallus of adequate size. I wrote about the  
  
tragic outcomes associated with assigning a  
  
male gender to kids with small penises." ... "I  
  
would take that back today." He would also take  
  
back his recommendations that doctors conceal  
  
intersex diagnoses from parents: "That's one of  
  
the most damaging things I said in my chapter.  
  
I myself used to tell families that their child's  
  
sex was 'unfinished' and compare it to a cleft  
  
lip; I assumed they could not accept the truth."
