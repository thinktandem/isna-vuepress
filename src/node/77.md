The Journal of Gynecology and Neonatal Nursing has published an editorial\n(Haller 1998) which cites with apparent approval the new model of treatment\nguidelines for intersex births offered by\n  
(Diamond and Sigmundson 1997) and by <span class="caps">ISNA</span>, including <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s web site\nURL. The most important features of the model are an avoidance of non-consensual\ngenital surgery on infants\n  
and children, and honesty with parents and patient. The <span class="caps">JOGGN</span> editor\nencourages readers to &#8220;pull the report by Diamond and Sigmundson from the\nlibrary; and then download the <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s\n  
recommendations for treatment of intersex infants, along with a complete\nbibliography on intersexuality, from the Internet (http://www.isna.org).&#8221;\n\n

The editorial accompanies a review article which presents without criticism\nthe traditional medical model of management of intersex births; indeed\nthe author encourages nurses to help parents invent\n  
falsehoods to conceal the child&#8217;s actual condition. (&#8220;[S]tating that\nthe infant is critically ill and in the neonatal intensive-care unit &#8230;\nwill usually dissuade further questioning.&#8221;)\n\n

However, in what seems to be a paragraph that was inserted as an afterthought,\nISNA&#8217;s &#8220;Recommendations for Treatment&#8221; are cited as a source of controversy.\n\n

It&#8217;s interesting to note that the editorial cites the review article&#8217;s\npresentation of what continues to be standard treatment (secrecy and surgery)\nas &#8220;more information and different views&#8221;\n  
no more or less authoritative than (Diamond and Sigmundson 1997) or\nISNA.\n
