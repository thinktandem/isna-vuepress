The Journal of Gynecology and Neonatal Nursing has published an editorial<br>(Haller 1998) which cites with apparent approval the new model of treatment<br>guidelines for intersex births offered by<br>  
(Diamond and Sigmundson 1997) and by <span class="caps">ISNA</span>, including <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s web site<br>URL. The most important features of the model are an avoidance of non-consensual<br>genital surgery on infants<br>  
and children, and honesty with parents and patient. The <span class="caps">JOGGN</span> editor<br>encourages readers to &#8220;pull the report by Diamond and Sigmundson from the<br>library; and then download the <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s<br>  
recommendations for treatment of intersex infants, along with a complete<br>bibliography on intersexuality, from the Internet (http://www.isna.org).&#8221;<br><br>

The editorial accompanies a review article which presents without criticism<br>the traditional medical model of management of intersex births; indeed<br>the author encourages nurses to help parents invent<br>  
falsehoods to conceal the child&#8217;s actual condition. (&#8220;[S]tating that<br>the infant is critically ill and in the neonatal intensive-care unit &#8230;<br>will usually dissuade further questioning.&#8221;)<br><br>

However, in what seems to be a paragraph that was inserted as an afterthought,<br>ISNA&#8217;s &#8220;Recommendations for Treatment&#8221; are cited as a source of controversy.<br><br>

It&#8217;s interesting to note that the editorial cites the review article&#8217;s<br>presentation of what continues to be standard treatment (secrecy and surgery)<br>as &#8220;more information and different views&#8221;<br>  
no more or less authoritative than (Diamond and Sigmundson 1997) or<br>ISNA.<br>
