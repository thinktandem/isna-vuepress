\nCorte Constitucional

\n  
\n  
\nDear Mr. Uprimny,  
\n  
\nThank you for providing the opportunity to comment on this case. As I understand\nthe case, physicians have asked for the Court to either approve performing\ngenital surgery on a six year old intersexed child, or to wait and allow\nthe child to make any decisions about surgery herself, when she is old enough\nto evaluate risks and benefits. Apparently the surgery contemplated is clitoral\nreduction, vaginoplasty (to create or deepen a vagina), or both. In a previous\ncase regarding an emasculated boy, the Court determined that all choices\ninvolving sexual identity must be made directly by the person, and not by\nthe parents.  
\n  
\nWe argue, in keeping with the Court&#8217;s previous determination, that only\nthe child has the right to make decisions regarding her sexual identity\nand cosmetic genital surgery. To impose surgery on her would subject her\nto an unnecessary risk of irreversible harm and violate her human rights.  
\n  
\nDuring the past several years, there has been an explosion of new scholarly\nwork which considers medical management of intersex children, and the surrounding\npsychosocial issues. Based upon that work, a growing consensus of surgeons,\npsychologists, psychiatrists, and ethicists argue against early genital\nsurgery on intersex children (Diamond 1996; Diamond and Sigmundson 1997b;\nDreger 1997a; Dreger 1998 forthcoming-a; Drescher 1997; Kessler 1998 forthcoming;\nSchober 1998). It would be a pity for the Court to create a precedent insulating\ndoctors from any liability for harm caused by performing non-consensual\ngenital surgery on children precisely at the moment when scholarly opinion\nis changing. It would be even more ironic for the Court at this moment to\nreverse its previous opinion, and negate the right of a child to make for\nherself all decisions regarding her sexual identity.  
\n  
\nGiven the fact that genital surgery is not medically necessary, that it\nis irreversible and potentially harmful, that there is growing controversy\namong medical intersex specialists, and that the child can always choose\nsurgery if she wishes when she is old enough to give informed consent, to\nimpose surgery now would violate the first principle of medicine: "Primum,\nnon nocerum" (First, do no harm).  
\n  
\nPlease refer also to enclosed Declarations from Cheryl Chase (Director of\nthe Intersex Society), Justine Schober M.D. (pediatric urological surgeon),\nAlice Dreger Ph.D. (narrative ethicist), and Lisset Barcellos Cardenas (a\nPeruvian woman subjected to nonconsensual genital surgery at age 12). All\nof these argue that cosmetic genital surgery should never be performed without\nthe express informed consent of the patient. Also enclosed is a letter in\nthe original Spanish from Ms. Barcellos to her doctor in Lima, insisting\nthat this practice is harmful, unethical, and must be stopped.  
\n  
\n  
\n  
\n**1. There is no medical reason to reduce the size of a large clitoris.**\nLarge clitorises do not cause illness or pain. The sole motivation for the\nsurgery is the unproven belief that it may enhance psychological well-being.\nThere is no medical reason to create or deepen a vagina in a pre-pubescent\nchild. The sole motivation for such surgery is the unproven belief that\nit may ease parental discomfort now or that the decision would be traumatic\nfor the patient to make later, so the surgery should be performed before\nshe is able to participate in the decision.  
\n  
\n**2. The surgery is irreversible.** Tissue removed from the clitoris\ncan never be restored; scarring produced by surgery can never be undone.\nSetting potential and speculative "psychological" benefits aside,\nthere no medical advantage or benefit to performing surgery now as opposed\nto later, when the child can make her own choice and when her gender identity\nis clearly established. "Surgery makes parents and doctors comfortable,\nbut counseling makes people comfortable too, and it is not irreversible"\n(Schober 1998, p20).  
\n  
\nThere are, in fact, clear medical benefits to delaying the surgery. When\nshe is grown, her genitals will be larger and thus easier for a surgeon\nto work on. One reason for poor surgical outcomes may be that scar tissue\nis negatively affected by the changes in size and shape that accompany normal\ngrowth and pubertal development; surgery performed after puberty would avoid\nthat risk. It is likely that surgical techniques will have improved by the\ntime she has grown; waiting will allow her to benefit from advances in technology.  
\n  
\nThere are many documented cases of people with her history who lived as\nadult women and were happy to keep their large clitoris intact, in some\ncases actually refusing surgery when it was offered (Fausto-Sterling 1993;\nYoung 1937).  
\n  
\nThere is clear documentation that a significant fraction of children with\nher specific medical condition and history develop a male gender identity,\nand live as men during adulthood. If she lives as a man, she will be grateful\nthat surgery was not performed without her consent.  
\n  
\nPhysicians in this case have asserted that the child can never live as a\nman, because her penis is never going to be sexually functional. But sexual\nfunction may mean different things to different people. The boy in the previous\ncase, who was accidentally emasculated, chose to live as a man even though\nhe had lost his penis. The men investigated in (Reilly and Woodhouse 1989)\nwere able to have satisfying lives as men, with no impairment of sexual\nfunction, with small penises that would be judged "inadequate"\naccording to the medical protocols used on intersex children. A small penis\nis capable of providing sexual arousal, genital pleasure, and orgasm. The\nvideo tape "I am what I feel to be" (Fama Film A.G. 1997) presents\ninterviews in Spanish with a number of people who were born as male pseudo\nhermaphrodites, raised female, and later changed to live as men. Both they\nand their partners describe their lives as sexually fulfilling, in spite\nof penises so small that they lived as girls until puberty (Fama Film A.G.\n1997).  
\n  
\n**3. There is considerable evidence that genital surgery can cause harm,**\nincluding such physical harm as scarring, chronic pain, chronic irritation,\nreduction of sexual sensation, and psychological harm. Indeed, apart from\nthe harm specific to genital surgery, surgery is never without risk.  
\n  
\n**4. No significant data has been collected on long term outcomes.** The\nbelief that these surgeries provide any benefit at all is speculative and\nunexamined. Given the clear risk of harm, the Court is obligated to protect\nthe child&#8217;s human rights by declining to approve the surgery.  
\n  
\n**5. The very fact that the physicians in this case hesitate to perform\nsurgery before operating indicates that they are aware that the surgery\nis risky and may cause immediate or future harm.  
\n  
\n6. Surgeons argue that genital surgeries must be performed on intersex children\nin order to save them from feeling different** from other children, or\nbeing marginalized by society. But many children grow up with physical differences\nwhich may cause them to be marginalized by society, yet we do not advocate\nusing plastic surgery to eliminate all physical differences. For instance,\nchildren of racial minorities are often marginalized, teased, and even subject\nto violence. Yet few would condone using non-consensual plastic surgery\nduring infancy to eliminate racial characteristics.  
\n  
\nPrejudice against people with unusual genitals is culturally determined.\nSome cultures have high regard for people with intersex genitals (Herdt\n1994; Roscoe 1987). As even Dr. Maria New, a pediatric endocrinologist who\nadvocates early genital surgery, concedes, our own culture was much less\nprejudiced before medical intervention began. [During the European Middle\nAges and Renaissance,] "Hermaphrodites were integrated quite forthrightly\ninto the social fabric" (New and Kitzinger 1993, p10).  
\n  
\nBut some surgeons who advocate early genital surgery for intersex infants\nmight consider surgical elimination of racial characteristics potentially\nacceptable. Dr. Kenneth Glassberg, a surgeon who heads the Urology Section\nof the American Academy of Pediatrics, was interviewed on the national television\nnews show <span class="caps">NBC</span> Dateline. He said that it was unrealistic to ask people to\nbe accepting of genital difference, because many people are unaccepting\nof racial difference (Dateline 1997). Yet the law addresses the problem\nof racism by trying to mitigate the power of racists to harm members of\nracial minorities, rather than by trying to eliminate the physical characteristics\nwhich mark members of racial minorities.  
\n  
\nLikewise, in this case, if there is intolerance of physical difference,\nthen the intolerance should not be addressed by using medically unnecessary,\nirreversible, potentially harmful plastic surgery to try to hide the physical\ndifference without the patient&#8217;s consent. This is particularly true for\na physical difference that is not visible to others in the course of normal\nsocial interaction.  
\n  
\n**7. There is good evidence that adults would not choose clitoral surgery\nfor themselves.** Psychologist Dr. Suzanne Kessler has documented this\nby surveying college students (Kessler 1997). There are many adult intersex\nwomen who express regret and anger that genital surgery was imposed on them\nas children.  
\n  
\n**8. Worldwide medical thinking about surgical management of intersexuality\nhas been strongly influenced by a case in which a boy whose penis was accidentally\ndestroyed during circumcision,** and who after being surgically reassigned\nand raised female, was reported to have had a successful adjustment. However,\nit is now known that, like the previous case of accidental emasculation\nwhich the Court is considering, the female reassignment was a disaster (Diamond\nand Sigmundson 1997a). The patient now lives once again as a man, and reconsideration\nof this case is causing experts to assert that early genital surgery requires\nthe informed consent of the patient (1997b; Diamond and Sigmundson 1997b;\nDreger 1998 forthcoming-a). "I recommend that genital reconstruction\nbe delayed until the individual is competent to decide for himself or herself\nhow this should best be fashioned" (Diamond 1996). "This damage\n[due to surgery] may be something a patient is willing to risk, but that\nis a choice he/she should be able to make for him/herself" (Fausto-Sterling\nand Laurent 1994, p10).  
\n  
\n  
\n**9. A safer alternative is clearly available, and is endorsed by credible\nexperts.**  
\n  
\nSex researcher Milton Diamond of the University of Hawaii Medical School\nand psychiatrist Keith Sigmundson of the University of British Columbia,\nbased upon their research of intersex management, provide clear recommendations\nfor how doctors can best serve intersex children. They recommend that the\nparents&#8217; emotional difficulties about their child&#8217;s intersexuality be treated\nby providing counseling for the parents, that ongoing counseling and honest\ninformation be provided to the intersex child in age-appropriate fashion\nas she grows, and that early genital surgery be avoided because it is irreversible\nand potentially harmful. "[The parents] desire as to sex of assignment\nis secondary. The child remains the patient." "Most intersex conditions\ncan remain without any surgery at all. A woman with a phallus can enjoy\nher hypertrophied clitoris and so can her partner. Women with [intersex\nconditions] who have smaller-than-usual vaginas can be advised to use pressure\ndilation to fashion one to facilitate coitus; a woman with [an intersex\ncondition] likewise can enjoy a large clitoris." "As the child\nmatures there must be opportunity for private counseling sessions &#8230; the\ncounseling should ideally be done by those trained in sexual/gender/intersex\nmatters" (Diamond and Sigmundson 1997b) .  
\n  
\nPediatric urology surgeon Dr. Justine Schober, in her review of clitoral\nreduction and vaginoplasty, concludes that "Surgery must be based on\ntruthful disclosure and support decision-making by parents and patient.\n. . . Our ethical duty as surgeons is to do no harm and to serve the best\ninterests of the patient" (Schober 1998).  
\n  
\nNarrative ethicist Dr. Alice Dreger recommends that intersex patients be\nallowed to choose surgery only with full informed consent of the patient,\nand that counseling and peer support be made available to parents, family,\nand patient (Dreger 1997b).  
\n  
\n10. Given the fact that genital surgery is not medically necessary, that\nit is irreversible and potentially harmful, that there is growing controversy\namong medical intersex specialists, and that the child can always choose\nsurgery later if she wishes, to impose surgery now would violate the first\nprinciple of medicine: **"Primum, non nocerum" (First, do no\nharm)**.  
\n  
\n11. Many of the factors which determined the Court&#8217;s decision in the case\nof the emasculated boy apply in exactly the same way in the present case.\nJust as in that case, there is **no urgency** to perform the surgery\nas evidenced by the fact that three years have now passed since the diagnosis\nand without surgery. Just as in that case, the **child is unable to give\nthe informed consent** which is necessary before such an important and\nlife-altering decision can be made for her. Just as in the previous case,\nthere is **no proof that this surgery would provide any benefit at all.

\n  
\nThe sole purpose of these surgeries is to enhance the long-term psychological\nwell-being of the patient. Yet there is no evidence that they do enhance\nthe long-term psychological well-being of the patient, there is no data\nwhich assures that they preserve sexual sensitivity and orgasmic function,\nand considerable data implies that they may actually harm the long-term\npsychological well-being of the patient. Therefore, although these surgeries\nhave been performed for many years, with numerous refinements of technique,\nand are considered by many surgeons to be standard practice, in pragmatic\nterms they should be considered experimental techniques which must not be\nimposed without the patient&#8217;s full informed consent.  
\n  
\nThe Charter and the Judgment of the International Military Tribunal (<span class="caps">IMT</span>),\ncollectively titled the Nuremberg Code, carry the weight of binding international\nlaw. See History of the United Nations War Crimes Commission and the Development\nof the Laws of War (1948) and Affirmation of the Principles of International\nLaw Recognized by the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal, 1946-1947 U.N.Y.B.\n54, U.N. Sales No. 1947.I.18. The very first trials held by the <span class="caps">IMT</span> at Nuremberg\nconcerned the use of medical practices on unwilling subjects. The medical\ntrials at Nuremberg in 1947 deeply impressed upon the world that medical\nintervention on unconsenting human subjects is morally and legally repugnant.  
\n  
\nThe Tribunal classified the commission of experimental medical practices\nwithout the consent of the patient both as war crimes and as crimes against\nhumanity. See History of the United Nations War Crimes Commission and the\nDevelopment of the Laws of War 333-334 (1948). The first principle of the\nNuremberg Code provides the patient/subject with the right of informed consent:\n"The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential.\nThis means that the peson involved should have legal capacity to give consent;\nshould be so situtated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without\nthe intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching,\nor other ulterior form of constraint of coercion; and should have sufficient\nknowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved\nas to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision."\n2 Trials of War Criminals Before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals under\nControl Council Law No. 10, at 181-82 (1949). See also the Helsinki Declaration,\nadopted by the World Medical Association in 1964 (recognizing the principle\nof informed consent and the right to be free from involuntary medical intervention.)  
\n  
\nThe prohibition on involuntary medical intervention and the requirement\nof informed consent are absolute; the Nuremberg Code governs therapeutic\nresearch that is intended to directly benefit or provide effective medical\ntherapy for the research subjects, as well as nontherapeutic research concerned\nwith the discovery of data. (See previous citation.)  
\n  
\nThe Nuremberg Code prohibits involuntary surgical procedures designed to\nalter the genitals of a six year old child for purely esthetic as opposed\nto medically necessary reasons. As discussed in more detail in the preceding\nsections, these surgeries are plainly experimental: (1) They are not medically\nnecessary to alleviate pain or any physiological dysfunction. (2) There\nis no medical consensus that these procedures are advisable or beneficial.\nOn the contrary, there is growing concern over the efficacy and ethics of\nthese procedures among medical experts in many fields. (3) There are no\noutcome studies to support the hypothesis that these painful, invasive,\nand irreversible surgical procedures result in any psychosocial benefit\nto the child or enhance the child&#8217;s well-being in any way. Conversely, an\nincreasing number of adults who were forced to undergo these procedures\nas children are coming forward to report profound physical and psychological\nharm, including pain, scarring, urological problems, loss of sexual sensation\nand functioning, and severe emotional trauma. (See Declaration of Lisset\nBarcellos Cardenas.)  
\n  
\nThe fundamental human right to be free of involuntary medical experimentation\nis especially clear and compelling under the circumstances of this case,\nwhich involves a six year old child who is incapable of providing informed\nconsent. Although parents have the right to consent to medical treatments\non behalf of a minor child under ordinary circumstances, this right does\nnot apply (1) when the medical treatment is not necessary to alleviate illness\nor pain; (2) when the only rationale for the treatment is speculative and\npurely psychosocial, i.e., to alleviate the possibility of social stigma\nby physically altering a child&#8217;s genitals to more closely conform to a cultural\nstereotype or ideal; (3) when the procedures involved are irreversible,\npainful, and may result in profound physical and/or emotional harm; and\n(4) where the irreversible outcome of the procedures will deprive the child\nof her right to determine her own sexual identity when she is old enough\nto choose.  
\n  
\nIt is repugnant and contrary to a child&#8217;s basic human rights to allow a\nparent to consent to medically unnecessary genital surgery for the purpose\nof dictating the child&#8217;s future gender identity or of altering the child&#8217;s\nbody to conform to an idealized cultural notion of "normal" genital\nappearance. This principle has been established in the analogous context\nof female genital mutilation, where a wide variety of human rights authorities\nand organizations have determined that involuntary genital surgery performed\non female children violates basic human rights to bodily integrity and personal\ndignity and autonomy. See Amnesty International, Women&#8217;s Rights are Human\nRights (1995).  
\n  
\nMany human rights bodies have condemned female genital mutilation, defined\nas the removal of all or part of the clitoris, inner labia, or outer labia.\n"Feminizing genital surgery" reduces the size of the clitoris\nby removing parts of the clitoris. (An earlier surgical technique which\nburied the clitoris has been abandoned because it results in pain upon genital\narousal.) Clitoral reduction surgery is thus clearly covered by the definition\nof female genital mutilation. Female genital mutilation has been condemned\nby the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, <span class="caps">UNICEF</span>, the World Medical\nAssociation, the World Health Organization, the 1993 United Nations World\nConference on Human Rights, and numerous non-governmental organizations.\nSee especially the Minority Rights Group International, Female Genital Mutilation:\nProposals for Change (1992): "While an adult woman is quite free to\nsubmit herself to a ritual or tradition, a child has no formed judgment\nand does not consent, but simply undergoes the operation while she is totally\nvulnerable."  
\n  
\nThere is no guarantee that the child will have a female gender identity\nas an adult. As discussed above, a significant fraction of children with\nher specific medical condition and history have a male gender identity as\nadults. If the child grows up to have a male gender identity, then the surgeries\nthat the doctors seek to perform will have been a terrible mistake. Moreover,\neven if her adult gender identity is female, there is no guarantee that\nshe will not regret any genital surgeries that were performed without her\nconsent as a child especially given the uncertain outcome of current surgical\ntechniques. Given the deeply personal and irreversible nature of genital\nsurgeries, the child herself is the only person who has the right to weigh\nthe risks and to decide what kind of genital alterations, if any, she would\nlike to undergo.  
\n  
\nParents have considerable legal control over their children, but they do\nnot have the right to disregard the child&#8217;s intrinsic human rights to privacy,\ndignity, autonomy, and physical integrity by altering a child&#8217;s genitals\nthrough irreversible surgeries based on an unproven and controversial psychosocial\nrationale. See, for example, the American Convention on Human Rights, Article\n1 (stating that "every human being" is entitled to the rights\nand freedoms recognized in the Convention); Article 5 (recognizing the right\nto "physical, mental, and moral integrity"); Article 11 (recognizing\nthe right to privacy); and Article 19 (stating that "every minor child\nhas the right to the measures of protection required by his condition as\na minor on the part of his family, society, and the state"). See, for\nexample, \n<A HREF="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/k2crc.htm" TARGET="_top">\nUnited Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</A> (signed by\nColombia 26 January 1990, ratified 28 January 1991), Article 19 (requiring\nall states "to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental\nviolence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment\nor exploitation . . . while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s)\nor any other person who has the care of the child"); and Article 37\n(requiring all states to ensure that "no child shall be subjected to\ntorture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment").  
\n  
\n  
\n  
\n  
\n**Summary**  
\n  
\nTherefore, we urge the Court not to approve the surgery, as a violation\nof the child&#8217;s human rights as previously ruled by this Court and as guaranteed\nby international law, and specifically not to indemnify physicians against\nliability for what they obviously regard as a questionable procedure with\na significant likelihood of resulting in regret, anger, and motivation to\nseek legal redress as the patient grows up and is able to take legal action\non her own behalf.

\nPS: You specifically asked for a copy of the article "The Five Sexes,"\nby Dr. Anne Fausto-Sterling. I have enclosed that article, but I would like\nto emphasize that, though the article is titled "Five Sexes,"\nneither Dr. Fausto-Sterling nor I nor <span class="caps">ISNA</span> is suggesting that there are\nactually five sexes. Dr. Fausto-Sterling and <span class="caps">ISNA</span> support the recommendations\nof (Diamond and Sigmundson 1997b). In the current case, those recommendations\nindicate that the child should continue to be raised as a girl, but that\nno genital surgery be done unless at her own initiative and with her informed\nconsent.\n\n

\nAppendix A  
\n  
\nFeminizing Genital Surgery is Medically Unnecessary**<FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />\n<BR />\n"Our needs and the needs of the parents to have a presentable child\ncan be satisfied. We argue that surgery in an infant maximizes a child&#8217;s\nsocial adjustment and acceptance by the family. But do we truly realize\nand promote the best interest of the adult patient in terms of psychosocial\noutcomes? This knowledge is still obscure and much remains to be discovered"\n(Schober 1998, p19).<BR />\n<BR />\n"The only indication for performing this surgery [clitoral reduction]\nhas been to improve the body image of these children so that they feel `more\nnormal&#8217;" (Edgerton 1993).<BR />\n<BR />\n"Scientific dogma has held fast to the assumption that without medical\ncare hermaphrodites are doomed to a life of misery. Yet there are few empirical\nstudies to back up that assumption, and some of the same research gathered\nto build a case for medical treatment contradicts it" (Fausto-Sterling\n1993).<BR />\n<BR />\n"The major justification for early surgery is the belief that children\nwill suffer terrible psychological damage if they and those around them\nare not crystal clear about which sex they belong to. Surgically altering\nambiguous genitalia is seen as an important component of clarifying the\nsituation initially for family and friends, and as the child becomes conscious\nof his or her surroundings, for the child as well" (Fausto-Sterling\nand Laurent 1994, p8). <BR />\n<BR />\nHopkins surgeons justify early genital surgery because it "relieves\nparental anxiety about the child with relatives and friends" (Oesterling,\nGearhart, and Jeffs 1987, p1081).<BR />\n<BR />\n"For a small infant, the initial objective is to feminize the baby\nto make it acceptable to the parents and family" (Hendren and Atala\n1995, p94).<BR />\n<BR />\n"Although gender assignment by genital surgery reassures adults, it\ndoes not necessarily require surgery, based on anecdotal reports of untreated\npatients" (Drescher 1997).<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<B>Appendix B<BR />\n<BR />\nLong Term Outcomes of Feminizing Genital Surgery are Unknown</B><BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\nThese surgeries have been widely practiced since the late 1950s. During\nthat time there has been a disturbing lack of follow-up. Because it is not\nknown whether these surgeries enhance psychological well-being, which is\ntheir sole legitimate purpose, these surgeries must be considered experimental.<BR />\n<BR />\nIn her forthcoming review of feminizing genital surgeries, pediatric urological\nsurgeon Dr. Justine Schober notes that, "The psychosocial long-term\noutcomes represent the most necessary information to determine if we are\nsuccessful in treating intersexual patients. However, in conditions other\nthan congenital adrenal hyperplasia, outcomes are generally unavailable"\n(Schober 1998, p20).<BR />\n<BR />\nIn a forthcoming book, Dr. Suzanne Kessler, professor of Psychology at the\nState University of New York at Purchase, presents results from her ten\nyear investigation of medical management of intersexuality. She notes that\n"Surprisingly, in spite of the thousands of genital operations performed\nevery year, there are no meta-analyses from within the medical community\non levels of success." "Even recent reports are susceptible to\na criticism about vagueness: The clitoroplasty is a `relatively simple procedure\nthat gave very good cosmetic results . . . and quite satisfactory results.&#8217;\nThe reader searches in vain for any assessment by which that was determined."\n"In none of the follow-up studies is there any indication that a criterion\nfor success includes the intersexed adult&#8217;s reflection on his or her surgery"\n(Kessler 1998 forthcoming, p106-7).<BR />\n<BR />\nDr. William Reiner, who switched in mid-career from urological surgeon to\npediatric psychiatrist, notes that "Past decisions about gender identity\nand sex reassignment when genitalia are greatly abnormal have by necessity\noccurred in a relative vacuum because of inadequate scientific data"\n(Reiner 1997a, p224).<BR />\n<BR />\nBrown University Professor of Medicine Dr. Anne Fausto-Sterling, in her\nreview of every case study located (in English, French, and German) on feminizing\ngenital surgeries from the 1950s through 1994, concludes that "these\nstandard treatment procedures are not based in careful clinical analysis"(Fausto-Sterling\nand Laurent 1994, p1).<BR />\n<BR />\n"Long term results of operations that eliminate erectile tissue [that\nis, clitoral reduction surgery] are yet to be systematically evaluated"\n(Newman, Randolph, and Parson 1992).<BR />\n<BR />\nPediatric urologist Dr. David Thomas of the University of Leeds, addressing\nthe American Academy of Pediatrics in late 1996, noted that very few studies\nhave been done to gauge the long-term results of early feminizing surgery,\nand the psychological issues "are poorly researched and understood"\n(1997a).<BR />\n<BR />\nHopkins Pediatric urological surgeon Robert Jeffs, reacting to picketers\ndemonstrating against early genital surgeries at a 1996 Boston meeting of\nthe American Academy of Pediatrics, conceded to a journalist that he has\nno way of knowing what happens to patients after he performs surgery on\nthem. "Whether they are silent and happy or silent and unhappy, I don&#8217;t\nknow" (Barry 1996).<BR />\n<BR />\n"Although these procedures have been performed for decades, no controlled\nstudies have compared the adaptations of children who had surgery to those\nwho did not. Anecdotal reports [that is, reports of former patients including\nintersex activists] carry much weight in an area in which data on long-term\noutcomes are sparse" (Drescher 1997).<BR />\n<BR />\nThe very fact that, in the current case, physicians hesitate to proceed\nwithout the approval of the Court, is evidence that they consider the procedure\nrisky and likely to motivate the patient to later litigation.<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<B>Appendix C <BR />\n<BR />\nFeminizing Genital Surgery Can Cause Harm</B><BR />\n<BR />\nThere is a wealth of evidence that these surgeries can cause profound physical\nand emotional harm.<BR />\n<BR />\nSee the attached Declaration of Lisset Barcellos Cardenas, which describes\nreduced sexual sensation, chronic irritation and bleeding, and abnormal\nappearance after cosmetic genital surgery imposed without her consent in\nLima Peru in approximately 1981. Ms. Barcellos would be happy to address\nthe Court, in her native Spanish, on the ways in which surgery has decreased\nher quality of life and her belief that these surgeries should never be\nimposed on unconsenting children.<BR />\n<BR />\nDr. Anne Fausto-Sterling documents scarring, pain, multiple surgeries, and\npatient or parental refusal of additional surgeries as evidence that surgery\ndoes actual harm (Fausto-Sterling and Laurent 1994,p5). <BR />\n<BR />\nIn a recent review of a dozen girls aged 11 to 15 who had undergone clitoroplasty\nand vaginoplasty, Dr. David Thomas concluded "The results are indifferent\nand, frankly, disappointing" with reconstructions showing visibly different\nappearance from the original cosmetic result, clitorises withered and obviously\nnonfunctional, and "every girl required some additional vaginal surgery"(1997a).<BR />\n<BR />\nAngela Moreno, who was subjected to modern clitoroplasty by experienced\nsurgeons in 1985, recounts that the surgery destroyed her orgasmic function\n(Chase 1997, p12).<BR />\n<BR />\n"Surgical reduction of an enlarged clitoris can at times damage sensation\nand thus reduce orgasmic potential and genital pleasure and, like ablation\nof the testes, is irreversible" (Reiner 1997b, p1045).<BR />\n<BR />\n"Aside from reducing potential adult genital sensitivity, [clitoral\nreductions] neglect the significance of any behavioral or psychological\npredisposition toward the individual&#8217;s own preferred sexual identity or\ngender roles" (Diamond 1996, p143).<BR />\n<BR />\nSex therapist Dr. H. Martin Malin discusses patients who had been subjected\nto early genital surgeries. "[their conditions, such as micropenis\nor clitoral hypertrophy] were not life-threatening or seriously debilitating.\n. . . [T]hey were told that they had vaginoplasties or clitorectomies because\nof the serious psychological consequences they would have suffered if surgery\nhad not been done. But the surgeries had been performed and they were reporting\nlong-standing psychological distress" quoted in (Schober 1998).<BR />\n<BR />\n"[S]urgery not only risked problems in psychological adjustment, but\nalso can permanently damage the individual&#8217;s ability to achieve orgasmic\nsexual function. This damage may be something a patient is willing to risk,\nbut that is a choice he/she should be able to make for him/herself"\n(Fausto-Sterling and Laurent 1994, p10).<BR />\n<BR />\nHopkins surgeons Oesterling, Gearhart, et al have recently acknowledged\nin the Journal of Urology that the most modern clitoral surgery "does\nnot guarantee normal adult sexual function" (Chase 1996).<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<B>Appendix D <BR />\n<BR />\nWomen can be well adjusted with large clitorises</B><BR />\n<BR />\nThere is no evidence that these surgeries are required for healthy psychosocial\ndevelopment. Indeed, there are many counterexamples, of people who lived\nor are living happily without surgery.<BR />\n<BR />\nHistorian Alice Dreger has documented many male pseudo hermaphrodites who\nlived happily as women during the 19th century with atypical genitals intact\n(Dreger 1998 forthcoming-b).<BR />\n<BR />\nAnne Fausto-Sterling documents 70 cases of children who grew up with ambiguous\ngenitalia, most of whom seem to have developed ways of coping with their\nanatomical difference (Fausto-Sterling and Laurent 1994).<BR />\n<BR />\nHopkins surgeon Hugh Hampton Young documents a number of women with large\nclitorises who were sexually active and who rejected his offers of surgical\ncorrection (Fausto-Sterling 1993; Young 1937).<BR />\n<BR />\nThe video Hermaphrodites Speak! contains an interview (at 24:35 on the tape)\nwith Hida Viloria, a young woman who discusses in a video interview how\nhappy she is to have been able to keep her large clitoris intact (<span class="caps">ISNA</span> 1997).<BR />\n<BR />\nEli Nevada also discusses her relief at having escaped genital surgery (Nevada\n1995).<BR />\n<BR />\n"Despite a large clitoris [this patient] does not wish any [surgical]\nmodifications to be made" (Patil and Hixson 1992).<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<B>Appendix E<BR />\n<BR />\nSome male intersexuals raised female switch to male sex role</B><BR />\n<BR />\nThere is evidence that some male pseudo-hermaphrodites, even if raised female,\neven if subjected to genital surgery, and in spite of having an "inadequate"\npenis, will change sex role during adolescence or early adulthood, living\nas men rather than as women.<BR />\n<BR />\nMoney found that three (10%) of 23 patients who were male pseudo-hermaphrodites\nraised female switched to living as men as adults (Money, Devore, and Norman\n1986). Dr. Howard Devore, a co-author of this study, is a clinical psychotherapist\nwith extensive experience in assisting intersexual patients and parents\nof intersexual children. Dr. Devore is an outspoken opponent of early genital\nsurgery and a member of <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s advisory board.<BR />\n<BR />\n"In fact, present data is increasing that despite great care in rearing\nthese [male pseudo hermaphrodites] as females, some, or perhaps many of\nthem, have strong male tendencies or may even change their assigned sex\nwhen they reach 12 to 14 years of age" (Reiner 1997a, p224). Dr. Reiner\nis engaged in a prospective investigation of fifteen male pseudo hermaphrodites\nassigned and raised female, with early genital surgery. To date, two out\nof the seven who have reached adolescence have declared themselves male.\nThe other eight are too young yet for any assessment (1997b). Reiner reports\na similar case, without prospective investigation, in (Reiner 1996).<BR />\n<BR />\nEven female pseudo-hermaphrodites assigned and reared female, with early\ngenital surgery, are considerably likely to switch to living as men as adults\n(Meyer-Bahlburg et al. 1996).<BR />\n<BR />\nThe video tape "I am what I feel to be" (Fama Film A.G. 1997)\npresents interviews in Spanish with a number of people who were born as\nmale pseudo hermaphrodites, raised female, and later switched to live as\nmen (Fama Film A.G. 1997).<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<B>Appendix F<BR />\n<BR />\nMen can be well adjusted with small penises</B><BR />\n<BR />\nSurgeons Justine Schober M.D. (ne&eacute; Reilly) and C R J Woodhouse M.D.\ninterviewed 20 patients who were diagnosed in infancy with micropenis. Twelve\nof these patients were adults (17 years of age or older) at the time of\nthe interview. All had stretched penis length smaller than the 10th percentile\none was only 4 cm (erect penis length cannot exceed stretched flaccid penis\nlength). "The group appears to form close and long-lasting relationships.\nThey often attribute partner sexual satisfaction and the stability of their\nrelationships to their need to make extra effort including nonpenetrating\ntechniques. . . . The small penis has not deferred them from a male sexual\nrole. [Nine of twelve of the adult patients] are already sexually active.\n. . . Vaginal penetration usually is possible but adjustment of position\nor technique may be necessary. . . . Two main conclusions may be drawn from\nour series: a small penis does not preclude normal male role and a micropenis\nor microphallus alone should not dictate a female gender assignment in infancy"\n(Reilly and Woodhouse 1989).<BR />\n<BR />\n"My own experience is that men with the smallest and most deformed\npenis can have a satisfying relationship with their partner" (Woodhouse\n1994).<BR />\n<BR />\nThe video tape "I am what I feel to be" (Fama Film A.G. 1997)\npresents interviews in Spanish with a number of people who were born as\nmale pseudo hermaphrodites, raised female, and later changed to live as\nmen. Both they and their partners describe their lives as sexually fulfilling,\nin spite of penises so small that until puberty they were considered to\nbe girls (Fama Film A.G. 1997).<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<B>Appendix G<BR />\n<BR />\nMost adult women would not choose clitoral surgery for themselves</B><BR />\n<BR />\nDr. Suzanne Kessler, professor of psychology at the State University of\nNew York, surveyed college women on their feelings about clitoral surgery.<BR />\n<BR />\nThe women were asked: "Suppose you had been born with a larger than\nnormal clitoris and it would remain larger than normal as you grew to adulthood.\nAssuming that the physicians recommended surgically reducing your clitoris,\nunder what circumstances would you have wanted your parents to give them\npermission to do it?" . . . All the subjects were shown a scale with\nthe normal ranges for clitorises and penises demonstrated in actual size,\nand labeled in centimeters. . . ."<BR />\n<BR />\n"About a fourth of the women indicated they would not have wanted a\nclitoral reduction under any circumstance. About half would have wanted\ntheir clitoris reduced only if the larger than normal clitoris caused health\nproblems. Size, for them, was not a factor. The remaining fourth of the\nsample could imagine wanting their clitoris reduced if it were larger than\nnormal, but only if having the surgery would not have resulted in a reduction\nin pleasurable sensitivity. Only one woman mentioned that other people&#8217;s\ncomments about the size of her clitoris might be a factor in her decision"\n(Kessler 1997, p35).<BR />\n<BR />\nThere is a wealth of literature available in which adults who were subjected\nto non-consensual cosmetic genital surgery as children express grief over\nthe physical and emotional suffering caused by the surgery, and anger toward\ndoctors who performed the surgery and parents who gave permission (Chase\n1997; <span class="caps">ISNA</span> 1997). To date, no adult has come forth to say that she was grateful\nfor having had this surgery performed without her consent.<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<B>Appendix H<BR />\n<BR />\nResponse to Doctors&#8217; Questions<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n</B><I>1. Our recommendations are informed by academic research.</I><BR />\n<BR />\nFor example, our recommendations are in concordance with those of the following\nrespected academic researchers:<BR />\n<BR />\nJustine Schober M.D.<BR />\nPediatric Urologist<BR />\nHamot Medical Center<BR />\n<BR />\nAnne Fausto-Sterling Ph.D.<BR />\nProfessor of Medical Science<BR />\nBrown University<BR />\n<BR />\nMilton Diamond Ph.D.<BR />\nProfessor of Psychology<BR />\nUniversity of Hawaii School of Medicine<BR />\n<BR />\nKieth Sigmundson M.D.<BR />\nDepartment of Psychiatry<BR />\nUniversity of British Columbia<BR />\n<BR />\nSuzanne Kessler Ph.D.<BR />\nProfessor of Psychology<BR />\nState University of New York at Purchase<BR />\n<BR />\nAlice Dreger Ph.D.<BR />\nAdjunct Professor <BR />\nCenter for Ethics<BR />\nMichigan State University<BR />\n<BR />\nHoward Devore Ph.D.<BR />\nLife Clinical Fellow <BR />\nAmerican Academy of Clinical Sexologists<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<I>2. <span class="caps">ISNA</span> performs research.</I><BR />\n<BR />\nWe are currently engaged, with the assistance of Aron Sousa M.D. and Justine\nSchober M.D., in a project which will use the new "Evidence Based Medicine"\nmethodology to analyze all available published outcome data on intersex\nmedical interventions. We are also engaged in a project, with the assistance\nof Justine Schober, M.D., to gauge the psychological adjustment of intersex\nadults, using a structured survey instrument.<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<I>3. Our recommendations are not based only upon technical limitations\nof older surgeries.</I><BR />\n<BR />\nThere is no evidence that "newer" surgeries preserve sensation\nor function. Indeed, because the surgery involves deep dissection and removal\nof highly innervated and vascular tissue, it is literally impossible for\nsensation to be unaffected. Outcome data from surgeries using similar microsurgical\ntechniques for reconstruction after trauma in adults (for example, facial\nreconstruction, or transfer of a toe to replace an amputated finger) indicate\nthat sensation is typically greatly reduced, but may be altered in character,\nor even painful.<BR />\n<BR />\nSeveral people have come forward, whose surgery was performed during adolescence,\nand who are now young adults. Thus, they provide good information about\nsurgical outcomes of only a decade ago. They report that surgery either\ngreatly reduced or eliminated clitoral sensation, or left them with chronic\npain. In some cases the pain did not develop until many years later.<BR />\n<BR />\nSurgery inflicts emotional harm, by legitimating the idea that the child\nis not lovable unless "fixed" with plastic surgery that is medically\nunnecessary and carries great risks. Some individuals subjected to old style\nclitorectomy surgery were lucky enough to retain sensation. They find themselves\nno less emotionally harmed by the surgery. For examples, see (Coventry 1997;\nCoventry 1998; Holmes 1997) and the letter from Lisset Barcellos Cardenas\nto her physician in Lima.<BR />\n<BR />\nSurgeons claiming to be developing the newest techniques concede that they\nhave no proof that surgery does not damage sexual function. The published\nresponse of authors Oesterling, Gearhart, and Jeffs to (Chase 1996) concedes\nthat their technique "does not guarantee normal adult sexual function."<BR />\n<BR />\nThere is even some evidence that the newer surgeries may be more harmful\nthan the older ones. All of the cases of chronic genital pain that we are\naware of are in patients who were subjected to "modern clitoroplasty"\nrather than older style clitorectomy.<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<I>4. Our recommendations represent the views of a large number of intersex\npeople and the growing consensus of professionals in many disciplines.</I><BR />\n<BR />\nISNA maintains a mailing list currently numbering 1000 people. Of those,\napproximately 250 have told us that they, or a child, or a spouse is intersexed.<BR />\n<BR />\nIn the past several years there has been a world-wide explosion of intersex\nactivism, with groups representing both intersex people and parents of intersex\npatients in many countries. See the Fall 1997 issue of the newsletter Hermaphrodites\nwith Attitude for news from intersex patient-advocacy movements in New Zealand\nand Japan. The following are among the intersex patient-advocacy groups\nwhich criticize current medical protocols:<BR />\n<BR />\nIntersex Society of North America<BR />\n<BR />\nAmbiguous Genitalia Support Network (<span class="caps">USA</span>)<BR />\n<BR />\nHermaphrodite Education and Listening Post (<span class="caps">USA</span>)<BR />\n<BR />\nMiddlesex Group (<span class="caps">USA</span>)<BR />\n<BR />\nAndrogen Insensitivity Support Group (<span class="caps">USA</span>, UK, Canada, Germany, Holland,\nAustralia)<BR />\n<BR />\nCongenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Support Network (<span class="caps">USA</span>)<BR />\n<BR />\nIntersex Society of Canada<BR />\n<BR />\nIntersex Society of New Zealand<BR />\n<BR />\nPeer Support for Intersexuals <span class="caps">PESFIS</span> (Japan)<BR />\n<BR />\nGenital Mutilation Survivor&#8217;s Support Network (Germany)<BR />\n<BR />\nWorkgroup on Violence in Pediatrics and Gynecology (Germany)<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<I>5. To date, no intersex person </I>who was subjected to early surgery\nhas come forth to say that the views expressed by these intersex patient\nadvocacy groups are not representative, or to say that they believe genital\nsurgery should be performed on intersex children. <BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<I>6. Surgery cannot prevent psychological problems. </I></P>\n\n

<P>
  Indeed, in many cases it is clear that surgery\nitself is the cause of psychological problems. However, even if there were\nsome former patients who felt that they were helped by early genital surgery,\nwe would still argue that non-consensual genital surgery on infants is unethical,\nbecause so many people are harmed.<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<I>7. Surgery does not provide "normal" looking genitals.</I><BR />\n<BR />\nIn a recent review of a dozen girls aged 11 to 15 who had undergone clitoroplasty\nand vaginoplasty, Dr. David Thomas concluded "The results are indifferent\nand, frankly, disappointing" with reconstructions showing visibly different\nappearance from the original cosmetic result, clitorises withered and obviously\nnonfunctional, and "every girl required some additional vaginal surgery."\n(1997a; Scheck 1997). Even surgeries performed by leading experts had poor\noutcomes: "Dr. Thomas pointed out that 70% of the original surgeries\nhad been performed by full-time pediatric urologists in three specialist\ncenters" (1997a).<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<I>8. Surgery does not prevent emotional suffering.</I><B> </B><BR />\n<BR />\nIn fact, there is evidence that it causes emotional suffering. "Many\nintersexuals report that the very treatments designed to prevent them from\nfeeling like shameful freaks are in fact causing them to feel that way"\n(Dreger 1997a). "Children born as intersexes face psychological difficulties\nno matter what treatment choice is made, and sophisticated on-going counseling\nfor both parent and child must certainly become, where it is not already,\nthe central component of the treatment process" (Fausto-Sterling and\nLaurent 1994, p 8).<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<BR />\n<B>References</B>
