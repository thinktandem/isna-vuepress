        Co-presented by Intersex Society of North America and United Genders of the Universe.<br /> <br> <br /> <br>Yellow for Hermaphrodites – Mani’s Story is a powerful documentary that traces the life of New Zealand intersex activist Mani Bruce Mitchell, who has confronted and overcome extraordinary pressures and exclusion. In her own words, Mani traces the momentous changes in her life, leading to self-acceptance and lack of fear in drawing attention to her ambiguous appearance. “I agreed to do this,” Mani says about the film, “as a queer-identified intersex person who believes with passion about creating change.” <br /> <br> <br /> <br><strong>Don’t miss this special <span class="caps"><span class="caps">FREE</span> </span>screening of this fascinating film followed by post-screening panel discussion!</strong>
