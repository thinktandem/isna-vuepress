<PRE><br>Havranek, Carrie. 1998. The New Sex Surgeries. Cosmopolitan, November, 146-50. <br><br>The November 1998 issue of Cosmopolitan<br>carried an article which positively<br>gushed about cosmetic genital surgeries.<br>According to author Havranek, women with<br>larger inner labia than outer can benefit<br>from having parts of their labia removed,<br>while women with weak PC muscles can<br>improve their sex lives with &#8220;Laser Vaginal<br>Rejuvenation,&#8221; and inorgasmic women may<br>become easily and multiply orgasmic after <br>pubic mound liposuction. <br><br>Although the article concedes that promises<br>of improved sexual response are unscientific,<br>and cautions that sensation may actually be<br>damaged, it repeatedly calls these procedures <br>&#8220;proven safe and effective,&#8221; and presents<br>only three patients, each of whom makes fantastic<br>claims of sexual benefits.<br><br>ISNA has been contacted by several women<br>who underwent these procedures, with disastrous<br>consequences (sexual dysfunction, chronic pain,<br>cosmetic disfigurement). For one such story,<br>(including an Edo period woodblock celebrating<br>the eroticism of large inner labia!), see <A HREF="../newsletter/winter94-95/winter94-95.html" TARGET="_top"><I>Winged<br>Labia: Deformity or Gift?</I></A>.<br>###<br></PRE><br><br>
