<PRE>\nHavranek, Carrie. 1998. The New Sex Surgeries. Cosmopolitan, November, 146-50. \n\nThe November 1998 issue of Cosmopolitan\ncarried an article which positively\ngushed about cosmetic genital surgeries.\nAccording to author Havranek, women with\nlarger inner labia than outer can benefit\nfrom having parts of their labia removed,\nwhile women with weak PC muscles can\nimprove their sex lives with &#8220;Laser Vaginal\nRejuvenation,&#8221; and inorgasmic women may\nbecome easily and multiply orgasmic after \npubic mound liposuction. \n\nAlthough the article concedes that promises\nof improved sexual response are unscientific,\nand cautions that sensation may actually be\ndamaged, it repeatedly calls these procedures \n&#8220;proven safe and effective,&#8221; and presents\nonly three patients, each of whom makes fantastic\nclaims of sexual benefits.\n\nISNA has been contacted by several women\nwho underwent these procedures, with disastrous\nconsequences (sexual dysfunction, chronic pain,\ncosmetic disfigurement). For one such story,\n(including an Edo period woodblock celebrating\nthe eroticism of large inner labia!), see <A HREF="../newsletter/winter94-95/winter94-95.html" TARGET="_top"><I>Winged\nLabia: Deformity or Gift?</I></A>.\n###\n</PRE>\n\n
