In a new study of facial attractiveness, researchers from Scotland and  
Japan have  
  
found that, much to their astonishment, people of both sexes prefer  
feminine-  
  
looking men over rugged, manly-miened men. When shown a series of computerized  
  
photographs of young men whose images had been manipulated to make  
them look  
  
either more masculine or more feminine than the norm, viewers designated  
the  
  
artificially feminized faces as somewhat more attractive than the average  
faces, and  
  
more appealing by far than the masculinized versions.  
  


The results, which appeared in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature,  
held cross-culturally,  
  
whether the faces shown or the people passing judgment were Japanese  
or Caucasian.  
  


The scientists had predicted that such traditional hallmarks of male  
dominance and maturity as a  
  
big jaw, square face, prow nose, and heavy brow would prove impressive  
to men and  
  
irresistible to women, who in theory are ever on the lookout for their  
alpha mate. Instead,  
  
appraisers seemed drawn to a touch of girlishness -- slender nose,  
cupid's lips,  
  
lightened brow, adorable chin.
