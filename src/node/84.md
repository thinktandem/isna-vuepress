**Angier, Natalie. 1998. Nothing Becomes a Man More Than a Woman&#8217;s<br>Face. _New_**<br>  
**_York Times_, August 31.**<br><br>

In a new study of facial attractiveness, researchers from Scotland and<br>Japan have<br>  
found that, much to their astonishment, people of both sexes prefer<br>feminine-<br>  
looking men over rugged, manly-miened men. When shown a series of computerized<br>  
photographs of young men whose images had been manipulated to make<br>them look<br>  
either more masculine or more feminine than the norm, viewers designated<br>the<br>  
artificially feminized faces as somewhat more attractive than the average<br>faces, and<br>  
more appealing by far than the masculinized versions.<br><br>

The results, which appeared in Thursday&#8217;s issue of the journal Nature,<br>held cross-culturally,<br>  
whether the faces shown or the people passing judgment were Japanese<br>or Caucasian.<br><br>

The scientists had predicted that such traditional hallmarks of male<br>dominance and maturity as a<br>  
big jaw, square face, prow nose, and heavy brow would prove impressive<br>to men and<br>  
irresistible to women, who in theory are ever on the lookout for their<br>alpha mate. Instead,<br>  
appraisers seemed drawn to a touch of girlishness &#8212; slender nose,<br>cupid&#8217;s lips,<br>  
lightened brow, adorable chin.<br><br>
