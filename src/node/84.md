**Angier, Natalie. 1998. Nothing Becomes a Man More Than a Woman&#8217;s\nFace. _New_**\n  
**_York Times_, August 31.**\n\n

In a new study of facial attractiveness, researchers from Scotland and\nJapan have\n  
found that, much to their astonishment, people of both sexes prefer\nfeminine-\n  
looking men over rugged, manly-miened men. When shown a series of computerized\n  
photographs of young men whose images had been manipulated to make\nthem look\n  
either more masculine or more feminine than the norm, viewers designated\nthe\n  
artificially feminized faces as somewhat more attractive than the average\nfaces, and\n  
more appealing by far than the masculinized versions.\n\n

The results, which appeared in Thursday&#8217;s issue of the journal Nature,\nheld cross-culturally,\n  
whether the faces shown or the people passing judgment were Japanese\nor Caucasian.\n\n

The scientists had predicted that such traditional hallmarks of male\ndominance and maturity as a\n  
big jaw, square face, prow nose, and heavy brow would prove impressive\nto men and\n  
irresistible to women, who in theory are ever on the lookout for their\nalpha mate. Instead,\n  
appraisers seemed drawn to a touch of girlishness &#8212; slender nose,\ncupid&#8217;s lips,\n  
lightened brow, adorable chin.\n\n
