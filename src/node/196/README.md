to assign a sex to an individual born with sexual ambiguity.&nbsp; The  
ambiguity may arise based upon chromosomal abnormalities or genital abnormalities.&nbsp; This  
article is aimed to assist the healthcare practitioner in identifying legal  
issues in hopes of improved patient care and avoiding liability.&nbsp; It  
is not the intent of this author to �choose sides� on the debate, but rather  
to illustrate legal practices and thinking.&nbsp; There are several assumptions  
that have been made in the production of this material.&nbsp; This author  
assumes that between one and two percent of all children born today may  
be intersexual.&nbsp; That term implies either abnormal chromosomes or  
genitalia sufficient to create a genital ambiguity.&nbsp; It is furthermore  
assumed that these abnormalities are recognized either at birth or during  
the early childhood of the individual.&nbsp; It is assumed that the child  
has either parents or another legal surrogate whom are in agreement as  
to whatever course of action is decided by them to pursue.&nbsp; They have  
sought medical advice, first from the child�s pediatrician and then probably  
thereafter, a pediatric urologist or general pediatric surgeon.&nbsp; This  
article does not address the actual surgical issues and it is presumed  
that the surgeon possesses the requisite skill and expertise to properly  
perform any surgery required.&nbsp; Rather, this article focuses on the  
issues of consent, whom makes the decision as to the type of surgery and  
when it is going to be performed, and adherence to the applicable standard  
of care for the healthcare individual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:normal;'><span  
style='color:black'>**A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Parents**</span></p>  


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under  
Florida law, unless there is a judicial decree to the contrary, the decision-maker  
for a minor�s health care decisions are the minor�s natural parents.&nbsp; A �minor� is  
defined by Florida Statute as �any person who has not attained the age  
of 18 years.�&nbsp; � 1.01(13), Fla. Stat. (2001).&nbsp; A natural parent  
has the right to the custody of his or her child absent conduct or conditions  
that justify a deprivation of the right in the interest of the welfare  
of the child and such a legal right should not be lightly regarded.&nbsp; Torres  
v. Van Eepoel, 98 So.2d 735 (Fla. 1958).&nbsp; The right to consent  
to medical treatment will typically reside in the parents who have the  
legal responsibility to maintain and support their child.&nbsp; O�Keefe  
v. Orea, 731 So.2d 680 (Fla. 1st DCA 1998). Although the parents� right  
to determine their child�s health care decisions is not absolute and there  
is some judicial authority to override the parents� authority, the courts  
have repeatedly held that it is the parents and their medical advisors  
that generally must make these decisions.&nbsp; In re Guardianship of  
Barry, 445 So.2d 365 (Fla. 2d DCA 1984).&nbsp; The love and affection  
of another person, no matter how great, is insufficient to deprive a fit  
and proper parent of the decision-making authority over his or her child.&nbsp; Modacsi  
v. Taylor, 104 So.2d 664 (Fla. 1st DCA 1958).&nbsp; In situations where  
there has been an adoption or a dissolution of marriage, the judicial decree  
will typically assign the decision-making authority to the adoptive parents  
or custodial parent.&nbsp; See generally Ch. 61, 63, Fla. Stat.  
(2001).&nbsp;

Decision-Makers and the Doctrine of _Parens Patriae_**<span  
style='color:black'></span></p>  
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As noted above, the parents� right to make the health  
care decisions for their child is not an absolute right.&nbsp; Under very  
rare circumstances, the parents� right can be overridden by a state court  
circuit judge.&nbsp; In these rare instances, the courts rely upon the doctrine  
of _parens patriae_<span  
style='font-style:normal'> or �substituted judgment� to justify judicial intervention.&nbsp; Occasionally,  
the courts find that their intervention is necessary on the basis that the  
parents have �abandoned� their child.&nbsp; This nomenclature is archaic  
and has given way to the more modern finding that the parents� decision,  
oftentimes based upon religious beliefs, is outweighed by the state�s public  
policy of preserving life or the overriding concern for the ultimate welfare  
or best interest of the child.&nbsp; See C.E.S. v. State, Dept.  
of Health and Rehabilitative Services, 462 So.2d 1160 (Fla. 2d DCA 1984).&nbsp; Medical  
care may also be furnished in the absence of parental consent if the parents  
have refused to give permission because of religious beliefs.&nbsp; J.V.  
v. State, 516 So.2d 1133 (Fla. 1st DCA 1987); see also M.N.  
v. Southern Baptist Hospital of Florida, Inc., 648 So.2d 769 (Fla. 1st  
DCA 1994); In re Barry, 445 So.2d 365 (Fla. 2d DCA 1984).&nbsp; </span></p>  


In M.N., the parents challenged an �order  
by which medical treatment was authorized for their eight-month old child  
B.N., without their consent.�&nbsp; M.N., 648 So.2d at 770.&nbsp; The  
child was admitted by the parents at the hospital, where she was diagnosed  
with acute monocytic leukemia, severe anemia and a low platelet count.&nbsp; Chemotherapy  
was then recommended as the most appropriate treatment for the child�s  
life-threatening condition, which necessitated blood transfusions.&nbsp; The  
parents refused to consent to this procedure based on their religious beliefs.&nbsp; M.N.,  
648 So.2d at 770.&nbsp; The hospital filed an emergency petition requesting  
an order as to whether chemotherapy and blood transfusions might be administered  
to the child without parental consent.&nbsp; In addition to their religious  
objections, the parents expressed concern that the proposed medical treatment  
would cause undue suffering to their child.&nbsp; After an evidentiary  
hearing, the trial judge entered an order authorizing the proposed medical  
treatment.&nbsp; M.N., 648 So.2d at 770.&nbsp; The parents then  
appealed the order to the First District Court of Appeal.&nbsp; 

  
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The First District then stated the law to be applied  
setting out the obligations of the trial court in applying the law.&nbsp; </p>  


<span  
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; Ordinarily, decisions regarding the care and  
upbringing of minor children will be left to the parents.&nbsp; This parent-child  
relationship is a fundamental liberty interest which is constitutionally  
protected.&nbsp; Padgett v. Department of Health and Rehabil-itative  
Services, 577 So.2d 565 (Fla.1991); In Re R.W., 495 So.2d 133  
(Fla.1986); see In Re Dubreuil, 629 So.2d 819, 827 n. 11  
(Fla.1993).&nbsp; But the parents' rights are not absolute, as the state  
has parens patriae authority to ensure that children receive reasonable  
medical treatment which is necessary for the preservation of life.&nbsp; J.V.  
v. State, 516 So.2d 1133 (Fla. 1st DCA 1987).&nbsp; And as between  
parent and child, the ultimate welfare of the child is the controlling  
factor.&nbsp; State v. Reeves, 97 So.2d 18 (Fla.1957).&nbsp; Indeed,  
the policy of advancing the best interests of the child is well rooted  
in this state and guides the courts in many diverse contexts.&nbsp; See,  
e.g., Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services v. Privette,  
617 So.2d 305 (Fla. ****</span><span  
style='font-size:12.0pt'>1993); Padgett; Dinkel v. Dinkel, 322 So.2d 22  
(Fla.1975).</span>

  


<span  
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; The state may override the fundamental liberty  
interest in the parent-child relationship only when there is a sufficiently  
compelling state interest.&nbsp; In Re Guardianship of Browning,  
568 So.2d 4 (Fla.1990); Dubreuil.&nbsp; Furthermore, the state's  
action must be narrowly tailored so as to produce the least intrusive interference  
with individual rights, although the preservation of life has been described  
as the most significant state interest.&nbsp; Browning.&nbsp; As  
with the parent-child relationship, the state's _parens patriae_</span> authority  
is thus not entirely unfettered.&nbsp; Rather, the state's interest diminishes  
as the severity of an affliction and the likelihood of death increase:

  


<span  
style='font-size:12.0pt'>[T]here is a substantial distinction in the State's  
insistence that human life be saved where the affliction is curable, as  
opposed to the State interest where ... the issue is not whether, but when,  
for how long and at what cost to the individual ... life may be briefly  
extended.</span>

  


<span  
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Satz v. Perlmutter, 362 So.2d 160 (Fla. 4th DCA  
1978), approved, 379 So.2d 359 (Fla.1980) (quoting Superintendent  
of Belchertown v. Saikewicz, 373 Mass. 728, 370 N.E.2d 417 (1977)); see  
also Browning; John F. Kennedy Hospital v. Blud-worth,  
452 So.2d 921 (Fla.1984); In Re Guardianship of Barry, 445 So.2d  
365 (Fla. 2d DCA 1984).</span>

  


<span  
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; The constitutional right of privacy may afford  
an individual suffering from a terminal illness the right to refuse medical  
treatment. Satz v. Perlmutter, 379 So.2d 359 (Fla.1980); see  
also Public Health Trust v. Wons, 541 So.2d 96 (Fla.1989).&nbsp; This  
right has been extended to incompetent persons and to infants.&nbsp; John  
F. Kennedy Hosp.; Barry.&nbsp; As Barry indicates, courts sometimes  
rely on the doctrine of substituted judgment in effectuating the privacy  
right of incompetent patients.&nbsp; Under this doctrine the court attempts  
to ascertain the choice which would have been made by the patient, if competent.&nbsp; However, Barry recognizes  
the inherent difficulty in applying this concept to young children.</span>

  


<span  
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp; There is no brightline rule or presumption that  
applies to the dispute here at issue.&nbsp; An illustrative listing of  
cases addressing this problem can be found in Newmark v. Williams,  
588 A.2d 1108 (Del. 1991).&nbsp; But the courts must carefully consider  
the facts and circumstances of each individual case as it arises, in weighing  
the various competing interests.&nbsp; Medical treatment may thus be rejected  
when the evidence is not sufficiently compelling to establish the primacy  
of the state's interest, or that the child's own welfare would be best  
served by such treatment.&nbsp; See Barry; Newmark.&nbsp; On  
the other hand, the parents' wishes may be overcome when there is sufficient  
medical evidence to invoke the state's parens patriae authority, and to  
establish that the child's welfare will be best served by the disputed  
treatment.&nbsp; See, e.g., In Re Cabrera, 381 Pa.Super.  
100, 552 A.2d 1114 (1989); In Re Wilmann, 24 Ohio App.3d 191, 493  
N.E.2d 1380 (1986); In Re Hamilton, 657 S.W.2d 425 (Tenn.App.1983); Custody  
of a Minor, 375 Mass. 733, 379 N.E.2d 1053 (1978).</span>

  


<span  
style='font-size:12.0pt'>M.N., 648 So.2d at 770-771.&nbsp; </span>

  


The First District then concluded that �in the  
present case it is not entirely clear whether the court fully considered  
all of the competing interests involved.�&nbsp; M.N., 648 So.2d  
at 771.&nbsp; �Given the nature of this dispute, we conclude that the matter  
should be remanded so as to ensure a balanced weighing of the various interests.�&nbsp; M.N.,  
648 So.2d at 771.&nbsp; �This necessitates [the] consideration of the parents� interest  
in making fundamental decisions regarding the care of their child, the  
state's interest in preserving human life, and the child's own welfare  
and best interests, in light of the severity of the child's illness, the  
likelihood as to whether the proposed treatment will be effective, the  
child's chances of survival with and without such treatment, and the invasiveness  
and nature of the treatment with regard to its effect on the child.�&nbsp; M.N.,  
648 So.2d at 771.&nbsp; Accordingly, it remanded the case to the trial  
court for a further evidentiary hearing on these issues.&nbsp; M.N.,  
648 So.2d at 772.&nbsp; In view of the considerations set out by the First  
District, and the past history of the Florida courts in these types of  
cases, it appears quite evident that the majority of trial judges will  
authorize the medical treatment for minors in such circumstances.&nbsp; 

  


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legal  
Standing**

  
<p class=MsoBodyText3>The state may have several interests in the issue of  
whether a patient may forego medical treatment.&nbsp; See In re  
Dubreuil, 629 So.2d 819, 822 (Fla. 1993); In re Guardianship of Browning,  
568 So.2d 4, 11 (Fla. 1990); In re Guardianship of Schiavo, 780 So.2d  
176 (Fla. 2d DCA 2001).&nbsp; The health care practitioner or provider, however,  
may not have standing to assert these interests in a petition to require  
medical treatment for a patient.&nbsp; See In re Dubreuil.&nbsp; At  
least for blood transfusion cases, the Florida Supreme Court removed standing  
from the health care practitioner and provider on grounds that there was  
a potential conflict of interest in requiring health care practitioners and  
providers to contest the wishes of their own patients.&nbsp; In re Dubreuil; Harrell  
v. St. Mary's Hospital, Inc., 678 So.2d 455 (Fla. 4th DCA 1996).&nbsp; Nevertheless,  
in the case of M.N., the hospital successfully brought a petition  
against the parents.&nbsp; If the health care provider does not have standing,  
the issue then becomes who does have standing.&nbsp; The answer to this question  
may lie in Rule 5.900, Florida Probate Rules.&nbsp; </p>  


**D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judicial  
Review**

  


In 1989, the Second District Court  
of Appeal issued a lengthy decision describing in dicta a method for judicial  
review of a surrogate�s decision regarding the substituted judgment of  
an incapacitated elderly patient.&nbsp; In re Guardianship of Browning,  
543 So.2d 258 (Fla. 2d DCA 1989).&nbsp; After the Florida Supreme Court  
reviewed the Second District�s decision, it realized the importance of  
creating an expedited judicial procedure for these types of decisions and  
requested the Probate Rules Committee to submit to it a proposed rule.&nbsp; In  
re Guardianship of Browning, 568 So.2d 4 n. 17 (Fla. 1990).&nbsp; In  
1991, the court created Rule 5.900, Florida Probate Rules, to assist this  
legal procedure.&nbsp; Rule 5.900, on its face, is not limited to situations  
involving elderly patients and appears to apply to all cases involving  
expedited judicial intervention concerning medical treatment procedures.&nbsp; It  
allows any �interested person� to file a petition.&nbsp; Rule 5.900 cautions  
attorneys to �note that the criteria and standards of proof contained in Browning differ  
from the criteria and standards of proof presently existing in chapter  
765, Florida Statutes.�&nbsp; Fla.Prob.R. 5.900.&nbsp; Accordingly, a careful  
review of Rule 5.900 is critical.&nbsp;

<p class=MsoBodyText3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While  
Rule 5.900, Florida Probate Rules, which is designed for expedited cases,  
may not be the most optimum avenue to seek judicial relief for cases of surgical  
intervention of intersex children with genital abnormalities, it may provide  
some guidance to attorneys and physicians of how to proceed.&nbsp; Most likely,  
if such a case were brought in Florida, the person disagreeing with the parents� decision  
would file a petition for injunctive relief in a state circuit court.&nbsp; He  
or she would then have the initial burden of establishing standing as well  
as the very heavy burden of establishing that the parents were unfit to make  
such a decision for their minor child.&nbsp; There are no reported cases  
in Florida involving this situation.&nbsp; </p>  


**II.<span  
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>****Informed  
Consent Issues**

  
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>**A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction**</p>  
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>The legal doctrine of informed consent is well  
accepted in the health care profession and the law.&nbsp; By now, generally  
limited by only their own financial constraints and resources, almost all  
patients understand that they have the right to make their health care decisions.&nbsp; This  
right, of course, exists even if the patients� health care provider knows  
better.&nbsp; As set out above, in the case of a minor, the minor�s parents  
typically make the minor�s health care decisions.&nbsp; In the case of an  
incompetent person, a guardian or surrogate or proxy makes the health care  
decisions after determining what health care is in the best interest of the  
incompetent person.&nbsp; The right to make a health care decision, of course,  
rests upon an informed basis for the decision, hence the term �informed consent.�&nbsp; Informed  
consent has been enumerated in several different sources of law, including  
the federal constitution, state constitutions, federal statutes, state statutes,  
and of course, the common law.&nbsp; As a general rule, a health care provider  
must obtain the informed consent of a patient for treating, examining, or  
operating on that individual.&nbsp; � 766.103(3), Fla. Stat. (2001).&nbsp; A  
failure to do so may result in liability for negligent treatment.&nbsp; An  
exception exists for emergency medical treatment that falls within the �Good  
Samaritan Act.�&nbsp; � 768.13, Fla. Stat. (2001).&nbsp; </p>  


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  
United States Constitution**

  


In Cruzan v. Director,  
Missouri Department of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 110 S.Ct. 2841, 111  
L.Ed.2d 224 (1990), the United States Supreme Court made clear that �a  
competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest  
in refusing unwanted medical treatment.�&nbsp; Cruzan, 497 U.S.  
at 278.&nbsp; �This notion of bodily integrity has been embodied in  
the requirement that informed consent is generally required for medical  
treatment.�&nbsp; Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 269.&nbsp; �The informed  
consent doctrine has become firmly entrenched in American tort law.&nbsp; Cruzan,  
497 U.S. at 269.&nbsp; �The logical corollary of the doctrine of informed  
consent is that the patient generally possesses the right not to consent,  
that is, to refuse treatment.�&nbsp; Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 270.&nbsp; Although Cruzan involved  
the right to refuse life-sustaining treatment issue due to �the advance  
of medical technology capable of sustaining life well past the point  
where natural forces would have brought certain death in earlier times,� Cruzan,  
497 U.S. at 270, its holding on informed consent applies with equal  
force to any issue involving informed consent.&nbsp; In fact, most  
of the early cases that discussed informed consent involved the right  
to refuse medical treatment based upon a patient�s religious beliefs.&nbsp; When  
the courts base decisions on the federal constitution, it typically  
means that the federal government or a state government has enacted  
a statute that encroached upon or limits a patient�s right to consent  
to a health care procedure or treatment or the right to receive information  
in order to make an informed consent.&nbsp; 

  


�But determining that a person has  
a �liberty interest� under the Due Process Clause does not end the inquiry.�&nbsp; Cruzan,  
497 U.S. at 279.&nbsp; Rather, the issue of �whether [a person�s] constitutional  
rights have been violated must be determined by balancing his liberty interests  
against the relevant state interests.�&nbsp; Cruzan, 497 U.S. at  
270.&nbsp; Thus, although a competent person may have the right to refuse  
unwanted medical treatment, the Supreme Court recognized that there are  
situations where that liberty right may not be violated by a state that  
prohibits the exercise of that right under certain circumstances.&nbsp; The  
Supreme Court then reviewed the factual circumstances involving Ms. Cruzan,  
an incompetent, where Missouri had a statute that �requires that evidence  
of the incompetent�s wishes as to the withdrawal of treatment be proved  
by clear and convincing evidence.�&nbsp; Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 280.&nbsp; �The  
question, then, is whether the United States Constitution forbids the establishment  
of this procedural requirement by the State.�&nbsp; Cruzan, 497  
U.S. at 280.&nbsp; The Supreme Court held that it did not.&nbsp; Cruzan,  
497 U.S. at 280.&nbsp; 

  


&nbsp; Petitioners go on  
to assert that an incompetent person should possess the same right in this  
respect as is possessed by a competent person. . . . The difficulty with  
petitioners' claim is that in a sense it begs the question:&nbsp; An incompetent  
person is not able to make an informed and voluntary choice to exercise  
a hypothetical right to refuse treatment or any other right.&nbsp; Such  
a "right" must be exercised for her, if at all, by some sort  
of surrogate.&nbsp; Here, Missouri has in effect recognized that under  
certain circumstances a surrogate may act for the patient in electing to  
have hydration and nutrition withdrawn in such a way as to cause death,  
but it has established a procedural safeguard to assure that the action  
of the surrogate conforms as best it may to the wishes expressed by the  
patient while competent.&nbsp; Missouri requires that evidence of the incompetent's  
wishes as to the withdrawal of treatment be proved by clear and convincing  
evidence.&nbsp; The question, then, is whether the United States Constitution  
forbids the establishment of this procedural requirement by the State.&nbsp;&nbsp; We  
hold that it does not.

  


&nbsp; Whether or not Missouri's  
clear and convincing evidence requirement comports with the United States  
Constitution depends in part on what interests the State may properly seek  
to protect in this situation.&nbsp; Missouri relies on its interest in  
the protection and preservation of human life, and there can be no gainsaying  
this interest.&nbsp; As a general matter, the States--indeed, all civilized  
nations--demonstrate their commitment to life by treating homicide as a  
serious crime.&nbsp; Moreover, the majority of States in this country have  
laws imposing criminal penalties on one who assists another to commit suicide.&nbsp; We  
do not think a State is required to re-main neutral in the face of an informed  
and voluntary decision by a physically able adult to starve to death.

  


&nbsp; But in the context  
presented here, a State has more particular interests at stake.&nbsp; The  
choice between life and death is a deeply personal decision of obvious  
and overwhelming finality.&nbsp; We believe Missouri ****may  
legitimately seek to safeguard the personal element of this choice through  
the imposition of heightened evident-iary requirements.&nbsp; It cannot  
be disputed that the Due Process Clause protects an interest in life as  
well as an interest in refusing life-sustaining medical treatment.&nbsp; Not  
all incompetent patients will have loved ones available to serve as surrogate  
decision-makers.&nbsp; And even where family members are present, "[t]here  
will, of course, be some unfortunate situations in which family members  
will not act to protect a patient."_&nbsp;_ In  
re Jobes_,_ 108 N.J. 394,  
419, 529 A.2d 434, 447 (1987).&nbsp; A State is entitled to guard against  
potential abuses in such situations.&nbsp; Similarly, a State is entitled  
to consider that a judicial proceeding to make a determination regarding  
an incompetent's wishes may very well not be an adversarial one, with the  
added guarantee of accurate factfinding that the adversary process brings  
with it.&nbsp; See __<span  
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive ****</span><span  
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Health_,_</span> 497 U.S. 502, 515-516, 110 S.Ct. 2972, 2981-2982, 111 L.Ed.2d 405 (1990).&nbsp; Finally,  
we think a State may properly decline to make judgments about the "quality" of  
life that a particular individual may enjoy, and simply assert an unqualified  
interest in the preservation of human life to be weighed against the constitutionally  
protected interests of the individual.

  
<p align=center style='  
text-align:center;  
'>\*&nbsp; \*&nbsp; *</p>  


&nbsp; We think it self-evident  
that the interests at stake in the instant proceedings are more substantial,  
both on an individual and societal level, than those involved in a run-of-the-mine  
civil dispute.&nbsp; But not only does the standard of proof reflect the  
importance of a particular adjudication, it also serves as "a societal  
judgment about how the risk of error should be distributed between the  
litigants."&nbsp; Santosky, supra, 455 U.S. at 755,  
102 S.Ct., at 1395; Addington, supra, 441 U.S., at 423, 99  
S.Ct., at 1807-1808.&nbsp; The more stringent the burden of proof a party  
must bear, the more that party bears the risk of an erroneous decision.&nbsp; We  
believe that Missouri may permissibly place an increased risk of an erroneous  
decision on those seeking to terminate an incompetent individual's life-sustaining  
treatment.&nbsp; An erroneous decision not to terminate results in a maintenance  
of the status quo; the possibility of subsequent developments such as advancements  
in medical science, the discovery of new evidence regarding the patient's  
intent, changes in the law, or simply the unexpected death of the patient  
despite the administration of life-sustaining treatment at least create  
the potential that a wrong decision will eventually be corrected or its  
impact mitigated.&nbsp; An erroneous decision to with-draw life-sustaining  
treatment, however, is not susceptible of correction.&nbsp; 

  


Cruzan,  
497 U.S. at 279-283.&nbsp; 

  


Significantly, in addition to the  
clear and convincing evidence standard, the United States Supreme Court  
also held that states are not constitutionally required to accept the �substituted  
judgment� of a patient�s close family member absent substantial proof that  
their views reflected the views of the incompetent patient.&nbsp; Cruzan,  
497 U.S. at 286.&nbsp; 

  
<p class=MsoBlockText>&nbsp; It is also worth noting that most, if not all,  
States simply forbid oral testimony entirely in determining the wishes of  
parties in transactions which, while important, simply do not have the consequences  
that a decision to terminate a person's life does.&nbsp; At common law and  
by statute in most States, the parol evidence rule prevents the variations  
of the terms of a written contract by oral testimony.&nbsp; The statute of  
frauds makes unenforceable oral contracts to leave property by will, and  
statutes regulating the making of wills universally require that those instruments  
be in writing.&nbsp; See 2 A. Corbin, Contracts � 398, pp. 360-361  
(1950); 2 W. Page, Law of Wills �� 19.3- 19.5, pp. 61-71 (1960).&nbsp; There  
is no doubt that statutes requiring wills to be in writing, and statutes  
of frauds which require that a contract to make a will be in writing, on  
occasion frustrate the effectuation of the intent of a particular decedent,  
just as Missouri's requirement of proof in this case may have frustrated  
the effectuation of the not-fully-expressed desires of Nancy Cruzan.&nbsp; But  
the Constitution does not require general rules to work faultlessly; no general  
rule can.</p>  


Cruzan,  
497 U.S. at 284.&nbsp; Thus, the Cruzan decision also impacts the  
determination of �who� may make a minor�s health care decision.&nbsp; 

  


**C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  
Florida Constitution**

  
<p class=MsoBodyText3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Separate  
from the United States Constitution, the Florida Supreme Court has recognized  
that the Florida Constitution �guarantees that �a competent person has the  
constitutional right to choose or refuse medical treatment, and that right  
extends to all relevant decisions concerning one�s health.��&nbsp; In  
re Dubreuil, 629 So.2d 819, 822 (Fla. 1993); In re Guardianship of  
Browning, 568 So.2d 4, 11 (Fla. 1990); Public Health Trust of Dade  
County v. Wons, 541 So.2d 96 (Fla. 1989).&nbsp; The Florida Supreme Court  
premised this right upon a person�s right to privacy under Article I, section  
23, of the Florida Constitution.&nbsp; It recognized, however, that where  
the issue involves a blood transfusion, the privacy right �overlaps with  
the right to freely exercise one�s religion.�&nbsp; In re Dubreuil,  
629 So.2d at 822.&nbsp; In a prior decision, the court held that a terminally  
ill incompetent person�s right to refuse medical treatment is the same as  
a competent person�s right to refuse medical treatment.&nbsp; John F.  
Kennedy Memorial Hospital, Inc. v. Bludworth, 452 So.2d 921 (Fla. 1984).&nbsp; In  
so doing, the court recognized the doctrine of �substituted judgment� under  
certain circumstances.&nbsp; Bludworth.&nbsp; Should there be any  
doubt in the determination of the patient�s wishes about living or dying,  
the default position favors life.&nbsp; In re Guardianship of Schiavo,  
780 So.2d 176 (Fla. 2d DCA 2001).&nbsp; </p>  
<p class=MsoBodyText2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps  
the most controversial of the right to refuse medical treatment cases are  
the ones where the patient refuses blood transfusions based upon religious  
reasons.&nbsp; In re Dubreuil, Wons, Harrell  
v. St. Mary's Hospital, Inc., 678 So.2d 455 (Fla. 4th DCA 1996); M.N.  
v. Southern Baptist Hospital of Florida, Inc., 648 So.2d 769 (Fla. 1st  
DCA 1994); St. Mary�s Hospital, Inc. v. Ramsey, 465 So.2d 666 (Fla.  
1985).&nbsp; The Florida Supreme Court has clearly held that a health care  
provider must comply with the wishes of a patient who refuses a blood transfusion  
unless otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp; See In  
re Dubreuil, Wons.&nbsp; The issue is clouded where the patient  
is a parent of a young child.&nbsp; Wons.&nbsp; The state has an interest  
in seeing that the child is not abandoned by the parent.&nbsp; In In re  
Dubreuil and Wons, the Florida Supreme Court held that there was  
insufficient evidence of child abandonment because the patient had a spouse  
or an extended family member that would care for the child.&nbsp; In view  
of the fact that the Florida Supreme Court decided the issue of informed  
consent on an express �right of privacy,� a right that was created in the  
state constitution after the creation of the right of informed consent, many  
of the court�s decisions look to Florida�s common law for its reasoning.&nbsp; </p>  
  


**D. The Florida Statutes**

  


### The Various Informed Consent Statutes

  
  


### The  
�Florida Medical Consent Law�

  
  
It is the most  
widely employed statute for informed consent, but is typically relied upon  
in cases involving competent adults making decisions about their ordinary  
medical care.&nbsp; It states in part: </h3>  


&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; No recovery shall be allowed  
in any court in this state against any physician licensed under chapter  
458, osteopathic physician licensed under chapter 459, chiropractic physician  
licensed under chapter 460, podiatric physician licensed under chapter  
461, or dentist licensed under chapter 466 in an action brought for treating,

of medical practice among members of the medical profession with similar  
training and experience in the same or similar medical community; and</span>

  


<span  
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; A reasonable individual,

would have a general understanding of the procedure, the medically acceptable  
alternative procedures or treatments, and the substantial risks and hazards  
inherent in the proposed treatment or procedures, which are recognized  
among other physicians, osteopathic physicians, chiropractic physicians,  
podiatric physicians, or dentists in the same or similar community who  
perform similar treatments or procedures; or&nbsp; </span>

the provisions of paragraph (a).&nbsp; </span>

  


<span  
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp; (4)(a)&nbsp; A consent which is evidenced  
in writing and meets the requirements of subsection (3) shall, if validly  
signed by the patient or another authorized person, raise a rebuttable  
presumption of a valid consent.&nbsp; </span>

  


<span  
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; A valid signature is one  
which is given by a person who under all the sur-rounding circumstances

or a person designated as the patient's representative.&nbsp; A patient  
has the right to refuse this information.</span>

  


<span

<p class=MsoBodyText3>� 381.026(4)(b), Fla. Stat. (2001).&nbsp; As with the  
state constitution right of privacy, the statutory bill of rights for patients  
was created well after the common law doctrine of informed consent.&nbsp; Thus,  
it too will most likely be interpreted in accordance with Florida�s common

style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  
Operation of the Informed Consent Provisions**</span>

  


**1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  
Duty to Obtain the Patient�s Informed Consent**

  


Generally, unless the patient�s  
treating physician is a hospital employee, a hospital cannot be held liable  
for the physician�s failure to obtain his or her patient�s informed consent  
because the duty falls upon the physician, not the hospital, to obtain  
the patient�s informed consent for the care and treatment being provided.&nbsp; Hospitals  
are not listed in the Florida Medical Consent Law, and in fact, are specifically  
excluded from this provision.&nbsp; � 766.103, Fla. Stat. (2001).&nbsp; The  
reasons for this exclusion are that: (1) in most situations, only a qualified  
physician has the training, experience and skill to obtain the patient�s  
informed consent for whether any particular medical procedure should be  
performed, (2) the physician is in a superior position to know the patient  
as well as the patient�s medical history, and (3) requiring only the physician  
to obtain the patient�s informed consent eliminates any potential conflict  
between the physician and the hospital.&nbsp; Thus, it appears to be Florida�s  
stated policy to protect hospitals from liability for obtaining a patient�s  
consent for a medical procedure performed at its facility by a non-employee  
physician.&nbsp; Cedars Medical Center, Inc. v. Ravelo, 738 So.  
2d 362 (Fla. 3d DCA 1999), review denied, 751 So.2d 1253 (Fla. 2000); Valcin  
v. Public Health Trust of Dade County, 473 So.2d 1297 (Fla. 3d DCA  
1984), approved in part disapproved in part, 507 So. 2d. 596 (Fla.  
1987).&nbsp; 

  


In a medical malpractice action  
based upon the failure to obtain a patient�s informed con-sent, the informed  
consent requirement is met where the following elements are established.&nbsp; 

  


<span  
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; The action of the health  
care practitioner in obtaining the consent of the patient or of a person  
authorized to give consent for the patient, was in accordance with the  
accepted standard of medical practice among members of the medical profession  
with similar training and experience in the same or similar medical community.&nbsp; </span>

  


<span  
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; From the information furnished  
by the health care practitioner, a reasonable individual would have a general  
understanding of the procedure, the medically acceptable alternative procedures  
or treatments, and the substantial risks and hazards inherent in the proposed  
treatment or procedures.&nbsp; </span>

  


� 766.103(3)(a),  
Fla. Stat. (2001).&nbsp; Ritz v. Florida Patient�s Compensation Fund,  
436 So.2d 987 (Fla. 3d DCA 1983), review denied, 450 So.2d 488 (Fla.  
1984).&nbsp; If these two elements are not satisfied, the physician may  
still nonetheless avoid liability if it can be shown that �the patient  
would reasonably, under all the surrounding circumstances, have undergone  
such treatment or procedure had he or she been advised by the physician,  
osteopathic physician, chiropractic physician, podiatric physician, or  
dentist in accordance with� paragraph (a).&nbsp; � 766.103(3)(b), Fla.  
Stat. (2001).&nbsp; Proof of a violation of the standard of care for the  
lack of an informed consent requires expert medical testimony.&nbsp; Valcin  
v. Public Health Trust of Dade County, 473 So.2d 1297 (Fla. 3d DCA  
1984), approved in part disapproved in part, 507 So. 2d. 596 (Fla.  
1987); Meretsky v. Ellenby, 370 So.2d 1222 (Fla. 3d DCA 1979).&nbsp; 

  


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  
Scope of Consent**

  


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A  
physician is not under a duty to explain all of the risks associated with  
a procedure, but only those risks that are substantial and inherent in  
the proposed treatment.&nbsp; A substantial risk inherent in a procedure  
or treatment is one that is recognized among other medical professionals  
with similar training and experience in the same or similar medical community.&nbsp; Public  
Health Trust of Dade County v. Valcin, 507 So. 2d. 596, 598-599 (Fla.  
1987); Ritz.&nbsp; Accordingly, in a case where the physician failed  
to inform the patient who underwent a tubal ligation that an ectopic pregnancy  
was a risk of the surgery, the patient was required to produce expert testimony  
as to the necessity of informing her of the risk of ectopic pregnancy.&nbsp; Faced  
with the medical expert witness testimony, the physician was required to  
rebut it with qualified expert witness testimony establishing that the  
risk of ectopic pregnancy was insubstantial or the failure to inform was  
still in accordance with accepted medical practice within the medical community.&nbsp; Valcin.&nbsp; 

  


**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  
Presumption of a Valid Consent**

  


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �A  
consent which is evidenced in writing and meets the requirements of subsection  
(3) shall, if validly signed by the patient or another authorized person,  
raise a rebuttable presumption of a valid consent.�&nbsp; � 766.103(4)(a),  
Fla. Stat. (2001).&nbsp; �A valid signature is one which is given by a  
person who under all the surrounding circumstances is mentally and physically  
competent to give consent.�&nbsp; � 766.103(4)(b), Fla. Stat. (2001).&nbsp; The  
Florida Supreme Court has ruled that this presumption of validity arising  
from a signed informed consent does not violate due process.&nbsp; Parikh  
v. Cunningham, 493 So.2d 999, 1001 (Fla. 1986).&nbsp; In determining  
the application of the statutory presumption of the validity of a signed  
written consent, all of the circumstances must be taken into consideration.&nbsp; These  
include the medical procedure itself, the inherent risks of the medical  
procedure and the adequacy and reliability of the physician�s means to  
communicate the medical information to the patient taking into account  
known language difficulties.&nbsp; Dandashi v. Fine, 397 So.2d 443  
(Fla. 3d DCA 1981).&nbsp; 

  


**F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Informed  
Consent for Minors**

  


Generally, the physician must obtained the informed  
consent from a parent or guardian in those situations where the patient  
is a minor, i.e., a person less than 18 years of age.&nbsp; � 743.01, Fla.  
Stat. (2001).&nbsp; A minor who has had the disability of non-age removed  
pursuant to the various provisions of chapter 743 may consent to his or  
her own treatment.&nbsp; There are exceptions to the general rule.&nbsp; Emergency  
medical care or treatment may be provided to a minor by a physician without  
parental consent if delaying treatment would endanger the health or physical  
well-being of the minor.&nbsp; � 743.064(1), Fla. Stat. (2001).&nbsp; Notification  
to the parents, however, �shall be accomplished as soon as possible after  
the emergency medical care or treatment is administered.�&nbsp; � 743.064(1),  
Fla. Stat. (2001).&nbsp; As set forth above, in rare instances, the courts  
have held that it may be proper to intervene to preserve a minor�s life.&nbsp; See J.V.  
v. State, 516 So.2d 1133 (Fla. 1st DCA 1987); see also M.N.

Ultimate Issue.**

  


# The ultimate issue presented at this conference rests upon a decision with  
respect

  


to  
the timing of surgical intervention.&nbsp; It is the informed consent and  
specifics of the information provided that will ultimately determine whether  
or not the healthcare provider has adhered to the applicable standard of  
care in dealing with the situation.&nbsp; Recent events and studies have  
raised some concerns about the traditional of early surgical intervention  
and the psychological ramifications.&nbsp; It is the recommendation of  
this author that these issues be communicated to the patients and/or their  
parents.&nbsp; Thus, the recommendation is for a more expansive informed  
consent that has traditionally been given when confronting these issues.&nbsp; This  
author recognizes that there is not legal decision in this country squarely  
on point.&nbsp; However, the emergence of peer reviewed literature suggesting  
potential harm for early surgical treatment to patients creates a situation  
where the healthcare practitioner must take these matters into account.&nbsp; Therefore,  
the&nbsp; more cautious approach should be to at least notify the decision-maker  
of the issues.&nbsp; It is recommended that this additional component be  
incorporated into the more traditional informed consent document, so that  
there is a clear written record that the information was in fact communicated.&nbsp; Of  
course, the precise information and language of the informed consent will  
be determined based upon the specifics of the individual set of patient  
circumstances.

healthcare professionals risk exposure to suit if their conduct in providing  
medical care falls below the applicable standard of care.&nbsp; Issues  
concerning the technical aspects of rendering medical care are not addressed  
in this article but instead negligence issues would center upon the advice,  
recommendation, providing of information, and referral issues.&nbsp; As  
a professional, the healthcare practitioner is imposed under the law of  
the State of Florida with the duty to perform requested services in accordance  
with the standard of care used by similar professionals in the community  
under similar circumstances.&nbsp; </span><span

which, in light of all relevant surrounding circumstances, is recognized  
as acceptable and appropriate by similar and reasonably careful physicians.�&nbsp; Florida

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify;line-height:

style='font-size:12.0pt;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none;font-weight:  
normal'>reassign the sex of infants with ambiguous genitalia at birth or as soon  
thereafter as is practical, but in any event within the first two years  
of the child�s life.&nbsp; This appears to be based upon the initial research  
and opinions set forth by Dr. John Money.&nbsp; Additionally, support for  
early intervention has been set forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics  
in a policy statement issued April 1996.&nbsp; American Academy of Pediatrics  
Volume 97, Number 4, April 1996.&nbsp; In the policy statement, the academy  
recommended surgery for orchidopexy and hypospadias to be performed between  
six and 12 months of age.&nbsp; This policy statement helps define the  
standard of care with respect to the timing of elective surgery on the  
genitalia of children born with genital abnormalities.&nbsp; It should  
be noted that the American Board of Pediatrics issued an addendum to their  
1996 position as published in Pediatrics 2000; 106:138-142.&nbsp; The Academy  
stated �the 2000 policy on Developmental Anomalies of the External Genitalia  
acknowledges the considerable recent debate about the appropriate general  
assignment of newborns with the most extremes forms of genitalia ambiguity,  
and notes that some have suggested that the current early surgical treatment  
be abandoned in favor for allowing the affected person to participate in  
gender assignment at a later time.�&nbsp; Recent studies and literature  
suggests that there is an emerging issue with regard to the appropriate  
timing of surgical intervention.&nbsp; As greater and more expansive studies  
are undertaken, the standard of care with respect to the timing of surgical  
intervention may in fact evolve.&nbsp; It is during this interim time period  
that the practitioner faces a true gray area.&nbsp; </span></p>  
<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify;line-height:  
200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where

style='font-size:12.0pt;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none;font-weight:  
normal'>the first year of the infant�s life, the standard would also require  
that the medical advice given to parents be in accordance with this early  
intervention.&nbsp; It can be argued that falling out side the main stream  
and recommending to parents that they delay surgical intervention does  
pose some potential risk to the healthcare practitioner.&nbsp; </span></p>  
<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify;line-height:  
200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It  
is the recommendation of this author that the practitioner avoid this  
pitfall by disclosing both schools of thinking to the parents.&nbsp; In  
this rather unusual set of circumstances, greater time and effort should  
be spent with a more extensive discussion and consent process than as traditionally  
undertaken.&nbsp; </p>  
<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify;line-height:

style='font-size:12.0pt;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none;font-weight:

and standards with respect to these individuals.&nbsp; At the present time  
however, this author has not located any legislature or court within the  
United States that has directly addressed these issues and the responsibilities  
of the healthcare practitioner with respect to them.&nbsp; There has been,  
however, one case decided in Columbia that has considered the issues.</span></p>  


# **B.&nbsp; Columbia�s  
Decision**

  
The Columbian Constitution Court issued two decisions.&nbsp; One  
on May 12, 1999 and the other on August 2, 1999 which addressed issues  
of surgical intervention in sexually ambiguous infants.&nbsp; The Court  
found that �parents cannot give consent on a child�s behalf on surgeries  
intended to determine sexual identity.�&nbsp; The Court indicated that  
children older than five (5) years of age are the appropriate persons to  
consent to surgeries to determine their sex.&nbsp; Additionally, in the  
other Order the Court found the Informed Consent given to parents of a  
child under the age of five (5) to be insufficient.&nbsp; At the present  
time I have been unable to obtain an English translation of these decisions.&nbsp; Assuming,  
however, that the English articles are accurate several questions come  
immediately to mind.&nbsp; First, a comparison of the Constitution of Columbia  
would need be compared to our own.&nbsp; There are perhaps some fundamental  
differences which could have a bearing upon the basis of the decision.&nbsp; Secondly,  
it is virtually impossible to imagine a scenario where a United States  
Court would allow a minor to consent to a surgical procedure.&nbsp; As  
stated previously in this article minors do not have the ability to enter  
into a legally binding contract.&nbsp; Since a medical consent is in fact  
a binding agreement minors would lack capacity to enter into it.&nbsp; One  
final thought on the Columbia case centers on their displeasure with the  
Informed Consent.&nbsp; As stated again it is likely that any decision  
in the United States will turn upon the issue of Informed Consent.&nbsp; Therefore,  
the issue that is presented in the Columbia case may be relevant to demonstrate  
to healthcare professionals Courts general attitude towards an adequate  
Informed Consent.&nbsp; </span></h2>  


# **C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Related Cases**

  
There are a number of related cases that although they  
are not authoritative on the issues at hand are none the less illustrative  
of the Court�s attitude towards a variety of issues respecting surgical  
sex changes.&nbsp; I include the Littleton v. Prange case cited  
in the 288th Judicial District Court, Bexar County, Texas, Case  
No. 98-CI-15220.&nbsp; This case did not involve an intersex issue but  
instead involved an individual who as an adult had surgery to transform  
themselves from a man to the physical characteristics of a woman.&nbsp; As  
a woman Ms. Littleton married Jonathan Littleton where they lived as husband  
and wife for seven (7) years.&nbsp; Jonathon Littleton died in 1996 allegedly  
as a result of malpractice of his treating physician.&nbsp; Ms. Littleton  
attempted to file an action under the Texas Wrongful Death Statute as a  
surviving spouse.&nbsp; The Defendant�s alleged that since Mrs. Littleton  
was in fact born a man and Texas did not recognize same sex marriages that  
she did not have standing to bring the action under the Wrongful Death  
Statute.&nbsp; The Trial Court agreed, granting Summary Judgment, and the  
issue was affirmed on appeal.&nbsp; Despite the fact that Christy Littleton  
had her birth certificate changed to reflect her as a female, the Texas  
Court looked beyond the ministerial act of the change of a birth certificate  
and found that since she was born a male she was unable to bring the action.&nbsp; </span></p>  


<span  
style='font-size:12.0pt'>There are also a series of cases that discuss whether  
transsexuals are in fact capable of marrying members of the same sex as  
defined at the time of their birth.&nbsp; There are some conflicting cases  
which may be more properly based upon that states a set of individual laws.&nbsp; These  
cases include Baehr v. Lewin, 852 P.2d 44 (Hawaii, abbr. 1993); MT  
v. JT, 355 A. 2d 204 Superior Court of New Jersey (1976); and In  
re: Ladrach, 513 N.E.2d 828 (Ohio, 1987); Anonymous v. Anonymous,  
325 N.Y.S.2d 499 S.C. Queens County, New York (1971); Baker v. Nelson,  
191 N.Y.2d 185 Minnesota, abbr. (1971) and Jones v. Halahan, 501  
S.W. 2d 588 Kentucky abbr. (1973).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>

  


<span  
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Several of these cases have been discussed in various  
Law Review articles.&nbsp; They would include an article titled �Sex Changes  
and Opposite Sex Marriages: Apply the Full Faith and Credit Clause to Comply  
Interstate Recognition of Transgendered Persons Amended Legal Sex for Marital  
Purposes.� 38 San Diego Law Review 1113 Fall, 2001 and �The Transsexual

# **D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conclusion**

  
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>While there presently exists a great deal of concern  
for the well-being of&nbsp; the individuals involved and the professionals  
continue to search for the answers, the focus for the health care professionals  
seem to have two rather clear pathways.&nbsp; The first is the pathway of  
inquiry and testing designed to determine whether or not the majority of  
persons treated by early surgical intervention derived a benefit or a harm  
from the surgery.&nbsp; At the present time it appears that there is a good  
faith effort on-going to arrive at sound conclusions in this regard.</p>  
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The parallel path is the path of the health care  
professional who is proceeding in accordance with the well established standard  
of care for surgical treatment of these individuals within the first year  
of their life.&nbsp; While these two paths may appear to be inconsistent  
with one another, in reality they may both be standard of care, if the standard  
is defined as such by the medical community.&nbsp; While it is certainly  
logical to assume that the standard of care cannot or should not be changed  
until the results of the on-going studies are known there does none the less  
arise a concern that the results may differ from the traditional recommendation  
course of action.&nbsp; As such perhaps the only prudent way to proceed is  
to outline to the decision-maker the present state of medicine and its potential  
evolution.&nbsp; Only in this manner can a reasonably prudent health care  
practitioner proceed with either treatment or delay with any degree of comfort.&nbsp; Because  
of this scenario a traditional Consent Form may not be legally adequate.&nbsp; It  
is recommended that a Consent Form contain not only the traditional risks  
of surgery and anesthesia but should include the potential future mental  
or emotional component in the event the chosen sex becomes inappropriate.&nbsp; In  
this regard there is attached as an addendum hereto a proposed Consent Form  
for treatment.&nbsp; It is hoped that either this Consent or one revised  
in accordance with the wishes of the participants herein becomes utilized. </p>

both individually and as the parents and natural guardians of _________________  
and hereby execute this Consent Agreement on this __________ day of ______________.  
20__ at _____a.m./p.m.&nbsp; This Consent is entered into pursuant to the  
Florida Medical Consent Law which requires our health care practitioners  
to advise us of the general nature of the treatment or procedures and the  
medically acceptable alternative procedures and treatments and the substantial  
risks and hazards inherent in the proposed treatment or procedures.&nbsp; We  
understand that our child has been diagnosed with a developmental anomaly  
of the external genitalia.&nbsp; We understand and acknowledge that this  
is not a life threatening condition and it is therefore not an emergency  
procedure.&nbsp; We recognize that the child faces potential mental or  
emotional harm from this condition.&nbsp; I have been informed that this  
procedure may be urgently needed in order to reduce or eliminate the potential  
harm to our child.&nbsp; It has been recommended to us by our health care  
providers that surgical intervention is in the best interest of our child  
based upon the current status of medical thinking.&nbsp; We have been informed  
that presently the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends surgery for  
this condition to be conducted within the first twelve (12) months of the  
infants life.&nbsp; We have likewise been informed that although the present  
standard of care is to operate within the first twelve (12) months on the  
infant for these conditions, there is presently an on-going debate as to  
whether or not it is in the best interest of the child.&nbsp; We have been  
informed that studies are on-going in an effort to determine the long term  
effects of surgical intervention on children born with genital abnormalities.&nbsp; These  
studies have not yet been completed, however, several individuals have  
come forward suggesting that surgery was not appropriate for their circumstances.&nbsp; Since  
the individuals that have come forward represent a minority of those who  
have undergone surgery of this type, greater research is needed in order  
to fully understand the ramifications.&nbsp; </span>
