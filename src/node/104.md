title: Texas Court creates Genetic Definition of Marriage
---

When Christie Littleton&#8217;s husband died under medical care, she filed a wrongful death suit against the physician. When the opposing side realized that Littleton was a transsexual, they asked the court to dismiss her suit on the basis that legal change of sex is impossible, so her marriage was invalid, and she thus lacked legal standing to sue. This case sets a precedent that could render many people with atypical genes ineligible for marriage. The decision&#8217;s author noted, but dodged, the complexity of legal sex of intersex people: &#8220;I express no opinion as to how the law would view [intersex people] with regard to marriage. We are, however, not presented with such a case at this time.&#8221; Read the Texas court&#8217;s  <a href="http://www5.law.com/tx/sub/opinions/fulltext/civil/1999d/04-99-00010.htm" target="news">decision</a>.
