# Madison Woman Discusses Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome

On Friday, September 21, 2007, the Oprah Winfrey Show interviewed Katie, Lynnell, Hida, and Arlene about their experiences of growing up with intersex conditions. Marcia from Madison Wisconsin took advantage of the attention to the issue to tell her story to the _Wisconsin State Journal_.  

<blockquote>
	Marcia says the Oprah show is an important milestone in talking about a condition that caused so much shame that her family and doctor hid the truth from her. She didn&#8217;t learn that she had XY chromosomes until she read her own medical records at age 35.  
</blockquote>

&#8220;I hope there will be other girls like me out there watching this and knowing they aren&#8217;t alone,&#8217;&#8216; she said.

Congratulations, Marcia!
