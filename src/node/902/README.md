ISNA&#8217;s former Director of Medical Education, [Alice Dreger][1], will give a lecture entitled &#8220;Measuring Phalluses, Separating Twins, and Speaking to the Dead: What History Tells Us about Today&#8217;s Creeping Norms&#8221; in the departments of History and Women Studies at the University of Wisconsin (Madison) on March 22, 2006, at 3:30 p.m. Dr. Dreger will be visiting the University of Wisconsin as a [Brittingham Scholar][2]. According to the University of Wisconsin&#8217;s [website][2], &#8220;the purpose of the Brittingham Visiting Scholar program is to introduce advanced students to those working &#8216;in the field&#8217; who can help them increase their awareness of the kinds of expertise and accomplishments they will need after they graduate.&#8221; Dr. Dreger appreciates this opportunity to talk with Wisconsin&#8217;s faculty and students about how academia and scholarship have advanced the cause of ISNA.
