COLOMBIA HIGH COURT RESTRICTS INTERSEX GENITAL MUTILATION

  
  


First High Court to Address Human Rights Violation

  
  


&nbsp;

  
  


BOGOTA, COLOMBIA -- The Constitutional Court of Colombia recently issued  
two decisions (SU-337/99, May 12 1999 and T-551/99, Aug 2, 1999) which significantly  
restrict the ability of parents and doctors to resort to the scalpel when  
children are born with atypical genitals. These surgeries -- also known  
as IGM, or Intersex Genital Mutilation -- have been widely practiced for  
over 40 years in most industrialized countries. In the US experts estimate  
that at least five children are cut every day. "Here in the US, doctors  
who perform IGM continue to reject the voices of those harmed by the surgery.  
Current laws do not protect us," noted Cheryl Chase of the Intersex  
Society of North America (ISNA).

This is the first time that a high court anywhere has considered whether  
IGM is a violation of human rights.

  
  


&nbsp;

  
  


Colombia's Constitutional Court went further than the pressing issue  
of IGM. The Court recognized that intersex people are a minority which  
enjoys the constitutional protection of the State against discrimination,  
and that every individual has a constitutional right to define his or her  
own sexual identity. The Court concluded both decisions with the same emphatic  
exhortation:

  
  


&nbsp;

  
  


"Intersexed people question our capacity for tolerance and constitute  
a challenge to the acceptance of difference. Public authorities, the medical  
community and the citizenry at large have the duty to open up a space for  
these people who have until now been silenced [...] We all have to listen  
to them, and not only to learn how to live with them, but also to learn  
from them."

  
  


&nbsp;

  
  


"We hope that human rights activists around the world will follow  
the Court's mandate," stated Sydney Levy of the International Gay and  
Lesbian Human Rights Commission. "Mutilation is torture any way you  
slice it."

  
  


&nbsp;

  
  


The Court's decision came after an exhaustive, year-long investigation,  
in which it weighed arguments by doctors and parents -- who insist on surgery  
to make babies "normal" -- against opposition to the practice  
by those harmed by IGM, including an amicus brief by ISNA. "The Court  
noted that this is not a medical decision, but a judicial and ethical decision.  
Ethicists in the US have uniformly denounced IGM as unethical, but until  
US courts act, American doctors will continue to perform IGM on 2,000 children  
every year," noted Chase.

In addition to the Colombian Constitution, the Court also based its holding  
on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. According to  
Shannon Minter, staff attorney for the National Center for Lesbian Rights,  
"the Court recognized that children are persons entitled to human rights,  
not simply the property of parents and/or the state. By holding that parents  
must place the well-being and best interests of their child above social  
prejudice, the Court affirmed the inherent dignity and worth of all children,  
including those who are gender variant." The US is not a signatory  
of the Convention.
