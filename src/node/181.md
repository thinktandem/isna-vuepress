First High Court to Address Human Rights Violation\n\n

&nbsp;\n\n

<span class="caps">BOGOTA</span>, <span class="caps">COLOMBIA</span> &#8212; The Constitutional Court of Colombia recently issued\ntwo decisions (SU-337/99, May 12 1999 and T-551/99, Aug 2, 1999) which significantly\nrestrict the ability of parents and doctors to resort to the scalpel when\nchildren are born with atypical genitals. These surgeries &#8212; also known\nas <span class="caps">IGM</span>, or Intersex Genital Mutilation &#8212; have been widely practiced for\nover 40 years in most industrialized countries. In the US experts estimate\nthat at least five children are cut every day. "Here in the US, doctors\nwho perform <span class="caps">IGM</span> continue to reject the voices of those harmed by the surgery.\nCurrent laws do not protect us," noted Cheryl Chase of the Intersex\nSociety of North America (<span class="caps">ISNA</span>).\n\n

&nbsp;\n\n

This is the first time that a high court anywhere has considered whether\nIGM is a violation of human rights.\n\n

&nbsp;\n\n

Colombia&#8217;s Constitutional Court went further than the pressing issue\nof <span class="caps">IGM</span>. The Court recognized that intersex people are a minority which\nenjoys the constitutional protection of the State against discrimination,\nand that every individual has a constitutional right to define his or her\nown sexual identity. The Court concluded both decisions with the same emphatic\nexhortation:\n\n

&nbsp;\n\n

"Intersexed people question our capacity for tolerance and constitute\na challenge to the acceptance of difference. Public authorities, the medical\ncommunity and the citizenry at large have the duty to open up a space for\nthese people who have until now been silenced [&#8230;] We all have to listen\nto them, and not only to learn how to live with them, but also to learn\nfrom them."\n\n

&nbsp;\n\n

"We hope that human rights activists around the world will follow\nthe Court&#8217;s mandate," stated Sydney Levy of the International Gay and\nLesbian Human Rights Commission. "Mutilation is torture any way you\nslice it."\n\n

&nbsp;\n\n

The Court&#8217;s decision came after an exhaustive, year-long investigation,\nin which it weighed arguments by doctors and parents &#8212; who insist on surgery\nto make babies "normal" &#8212; against opposition to the practice\nby those harmed by <span class="caps">IGM</span>, including an amicus brief by <span class="caps">ISNA</span>. "The Court\nnoted that this is not a medical decision, but a judicial and ethical decision.\nEthicists in the US have uniformly denounced <span class="caps">IGM</span> as unethical, but until\nUS courts act, American doctors will continue to perform <span class="caps">IGM</span> on 2,000 children\nevery year," noted Chase.\n\n

&nbsp;\n\n

In addition to the Colombian Constitution, the Court also based its holding\non the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. According to\nShannon Minter, staff attorney for the National Center for Lesbian Rights,\n"the Court recognized that children are persons entitled to human rights,\nnot simply the property of parents and/or the state. By holding that parents\nmust place the well-being and best interests of their child above social\nprejudice, the Court affirmed the inherent dignity and worth of all children,\nincluding those who are gender variant." The US is not a signatory\nof the Convention.\n\n
