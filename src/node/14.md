<FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Inside Edition</I> Gets It Right and Presents Out,\nUnashamed Intersexed People: Their Words, Their Lives and No Disguises</FONT>\n\n

On Monday, Sept 11 1997 the television news magazine Inside Edition\npresented candid interviews with four out, socially and politically aware\nintersexed people in its segment addressing intersexuality,&#8220;Caught In The\nMiddle&#8221;. Unlike another story addressing intersexuality presented earlier\nin the month by <span class="caps">ABC</span>s Prime Time Live, Inside Edition chose not to focus\non the medical establishment&#8217;s view of how best to deal with the problem\nof an intersexed child or its debate over how best to &#8220;medically manage&#8221;\nthe birth of an intersexed neonate with surgical intervention. Instead,\nviewers heard the forthright statements of four intersexed people, three\nof whom are living with, and recovering from, the results of the current\ntreatment methodology which requires that intersexed people be &#8220;fixed&#8221;\nby means of surgery and other medical interventions which intersexed people\n  
experience as physically and psychologically harmful.\n\n

Until quite recently it was not possible to learn how intersexed people\nfelt about their lives, how they fared after a history of childhood medicalization,\nbecause of the personal trauma that kept\n  
intersexuals silent. In the words of intersex activist Max Beck: &#8220;What\nwas going on inside of me didn&#8217;t have very much to do with sex or gender;\nwhat was going on inside of me was about shame.&#8221; In simply presenting intersexuals\nas real people with a voice of their own, Inside Edition has aided in our\neffort to halt unconsented surgery and remove the socio-medical stigma\nassociated with being born with non-standard biology. Hida, an intersexed\nperson who was not subjected to surgery, sums it up: &#8220;For most of them\nit doesn&#8217;t even get to formulating a new identity; it&#8217;s recovering.&#8221;\n\n

Also interviewed was Dr. Anne Fausto-Sterling, Professor of molecular\nbiology at Brown university, whose unbiased research has figured strongly\nin the efforts of intersex activists to demythologize the social and medical\nmisconceptions surrounding intersexuality.\n\n

We would like to commend Inside Edition for its sensitive and appropriate\ntreatment of intersex experience. Though imperfect, intersex surgery is\nnot &#8220;gender reassignment surgery&#8221; for instance,\n  
and it seems that the need for sex dichotomy was manifested in defining\nMax Beck as &#8220;a man&#8221;&#8230; Inside Edition&#8217;s &#8220;Caught In The Middle&#8221; succeeded\nadmirably in presenting the voices of intersexed\n  
people, heretofore unheard.\n
