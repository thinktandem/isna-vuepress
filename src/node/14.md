_Inside Edition_ Gets It Right and Presents Out,  
Unashamed Intersexed People: Their Words, Their Lives and No Disguises  
  


On Monday, Sept 11 1997 the television news magazine Inside Edition  
presented candid interviews with four out, socially and politically aware  
intersexed people in its segment addressing intersexuality,"Caught In The  
Middle". Unlike another story addressing intersexuality presented earlier  
in the month by ABCs Prime Time Live, Inside Edition chose not to focus  
on the medical establishment's view of how best to deal with the problem  
of an intersexed child or its debate over how best to "medically manage"  
the birth of an intersexed neonate with surgical intervention. Instead,  
viewers heard the forthright statements of four intersexed people, three  
of whom are living with, and recovering from, the results of the current  
treatment methodology which requires that intersexed people be "fixed"  
by means of surgery and other medical interventions which intersexed people  
  
experience as physically and psychologically harmful.  
  


Until quite recently it was not possible to learn how intersexed people  
felt about their lives, how they fared after a history of childhood medicalization,  
because of the personal trauma that kept  
  
intersexuals silent. In the words of intersex activist Max Beck: "What  
was going on inside of me didn't have very much to do with sex or gender;  
what was going on inside of me was about shame." In simply presenting intersexuals  
as real people with a voice of their own, Inside Edition has aided in our  
effort to halt unconsented surgery and remove the socio-medical stigma  
associated with being born with non-standard biology. Hida, an intersexed  
person who was not subjected to surgery, sums it up: "For most of them  
it doesn't even get to formulating a new identity; it's recovering."  
  


Also interviewed was Dr. Anne Fausto-Sterling, Professor of molecular  
biology at Brown university, whose unbiased research has figured strongly  
in the efforts of intersex activists to demythologize the social and medical  
misconceptions surrounding intersexuality.  
  


We would like to commend Inside Edition for its sensitive and appropriate  
treatment of intersex experience. Though imperfect, intersex surgery is  
not "gender reassignment surgery" for instance,  
  
and it seems that the need for sex dichotomy was manifested in defining  
Max Beck as "a man"... Inside Edition's "Caught In The Middle" succeeded  
admirably in presenting the voices of intersexed  
  
people, heretofore unheard.
