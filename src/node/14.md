<FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Inside Edition</I> Gets It Right and Presents Out,<br>Unashamed Intersexed People: Their Words, Their Lives and No Disguises</FONT><br><br>

On Monday, Sept 11 1997 the television news magazine Inside Edition<br>presented candid interviews with four out, socially and politically aware<br>intersexed people in its segment addressing intersexuality,&#8220;Caught In The<br>Middle&#8221;. Unlike another story addressing intersexuality presented earlier<br>in the month by <span class="caps">ABC</span>s Prime Time Live, Inside Edition chose not to focus<br>on the medical establishment&#8217;s view of how best to deal with the problem<br>of an intersexed child or its debate over how best to &#8220;medically manage&#8221;<br>the birth of an intersexed neonate with surgical intervention. Instead,<br>viewers heard the forthright statements of four intersexed people, three<br>of whom are living with, and recovering from, the results of the current<br>treatment methodology which requires that intersexed people be &#8220;fixed&#8221;<br>by means of surgery and other medical interventions which intersexed people<br>  
experience as physically and psychologically harmful.<br><br>

Until quite recently it was not possible to learn how intersexed people<br>felt about their lives, how they fared after a history of childhood medicalization,<br>because of the personal trauma that kept<br>  
intersexuals silent. In the words of intersex activist Max Beck: &#8220;What<br>was going on inside of me didn&#8217;t have very much to do with sex or gender;<br>what was going on inside of me was about shame.&#8221; In simply presenting intersexuals<br>as real people with a voice of their own, Inside Edition has aided in our<br>effort to halt unconsented surgery and remove the socio-medical stigma<br>associated with being born with non-standard biology. Hida, an intersexed<br>person who was not subjected to surgery, sums it up: &#8220;For most of them<br>it doesn&#8217;t even get to formulating a new identity; it&#8217;s recovering.&#8221;<br><br>

Also interviewed was Dr. Anne Fausto-Sterling, Professor of molecular<br>biology at Brown university, whose unbiased research has figured strongly<br>in the efforts of intersex activists to demythologize the social and medical<br>misconceptions surrounding intersexuality.<br><br>

We would like to commend Inside Edition for its sensitive and appropriate<br>treatment of intersex experience. Though imperfect, intersex surgery is<br>not &#8220;gender reassignment surgery&#8221; for instance,<br>  
and it seems that the need for sex dichotomy was manifested in defining<br>Max Beck as &#8220;a man&#8221;&#8230; Inside Edition&#8217;s &#8220;Caught In The Middle&#8221; succeeded<br>admirably in presenting the voices of intersexed<br>  
people, heretofore unheard.<br>
