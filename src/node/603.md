Meyer-Bahlburg, H. F. L., C. J. Migeon, et al. (2004). "Attitudes of adult 46,xy intersex persons to clinical management policies." _Journal of Urology_ 171: 1615-9.  
  
Well, we are pleased that some clinicians are starting to try to talk to their former patients. But they continue to confuse sex assignment and early genital surgery, to use the anachronistic term "unfinished" when referring to genitals with atypical appearance, to imply that any change in policy would require inventing a third sex. Finally, the authors apparently believe that if a simple majority of patients are satisfied with the gender assigned, then current policies are justified and no reform is needed. Too bad the editors of the Journal of Urology didn't insist that the authors provide references for the ideas they attribute to their critics.
