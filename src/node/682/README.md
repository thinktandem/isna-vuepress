# Law and Order SVU does John/Joan story

<p>On Jan. 18, 2005 <span class="caps">NBC</span> aired an episode (&#8220;Identity&#8221;) of Law &amp; Order <span class="caps">SVU</span> closely mimicking <a href="/node/598textileRef%3A17248076925d8ccdd33ec54%3A2%3Ashelveas">David Reimer&#8217;s story</a> a plot, right down to a vaporized penis, quotes like &#8220;easier to dig a hole than build a pole,&#8221; secrets and lies and a very unsavory representation of a doctor implicitly modeled after John Money. (Note that John Money is actually a psychologist, not a medical doctor.) If you see it pop up on the tv schedule in re-runs (often on the <span class="caps">USA</span> Network), check it out.</p>
