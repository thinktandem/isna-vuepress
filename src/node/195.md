\nThree intersex advocates held an educational outreach in conjunction \nwith opening night of The Vagina Monologues Dec. 27 on the sidewalk \nin front of the Portland Center for the Performing Arts.\n

\nAt issue is a segment of the popular play in which writer Eve Ensler \ntells &#8220;a wonderful vagina fairy tale&#8221; she heard in Oklahoma City. \nThe monologue involves a father consoling his 14-year-old daughter, \nwho just has learned she was born without a vagina.\n

\n&#8220;We&#8217;re gonna get you the best homemade pussy in America,&#8221; he tells \nher. &#8220;And when you meet your husband he&#8217;s gonna know we had it made \nspecially for him.&#8221;\n

\nEmi Koyama &#8211; one of only two paid intersex activists in the world &#8211; \ncalls Monologues fun and insightful but says this particular segment \nis misleading. She helped hand out 350 fliers explaining the \ncondition, which is known as vaginal agenasis.\n

\nKoyama works for the Intersex Society of North America, which seeks \nto end shame, secrecy and unwanted genital surgeries on children. \nShe notes the segment also suggests that women&#8217;s bodies are made \nsolely for husbands and that they should be altered to match what \nmen desire.\n

\n&#8220;Many intersex people who saw the play found this monologue &#8211; and \nthe roomful of laughter following it &#8211; hurtful if not outright \noffensive,&#8221; Koyama says, &#8220;We went home feeling sick or in tears, \nwhile all other women talked to each other endlessly about how \nempowered they felt.&#8221;\n

\nAccording to Koyama, the goal of the outreach was not to protest The \nVagina Monologues but to raise awareness and visibility. Similar \nactions have been held in Ann Arbor, Mich., and Boston.\n

\n&#8220;This is not just a play; this is a movement,&#8221; Koyama says. &#8220;I want \nto make sure that it accurately reflects intersex experience.&#8221;\n

\nKoyama&#8217;s efforts seem to be paying off: When The Vagina Monologues \nplays next month at Portland State University, she will be able to \nset up an informational table and to insert the fliers into the \nprograms. Promoters also have agreed to write a letter to Ensler and \nto donate some of the proceeds to Intersex Initiative Portland and \nthe Survivor Project.\n
