<FONT SIZE="+1">Intersex discrimination permissable under law according\nto Pennsylvania court</FONT>\n\n

It has been brought to our attention that the United States District\nCourt, E.D. Pennsylvania, is on record with a finding that discrimination\non the basis of a history of genital plastic surgery for an intersex condition\nis permissible under the law. Note that the court did not make any judgment\n  
about whether or not discrimination actually occurred in this case;\nrather it found that, even assuming that discrimination alleged by plaintiff\nhad occurred, she is not entitled to relief under the law.\n\n

Below, some excerpts from 660 F. Supp. 176 (E.D.Pa 1987):\n\n

Worker brought action claiming employer discriminated against her based\non sex in violation of the Pennsylvania Human Rights Act by failing to\npromote worker and terminating her solely because her employer learned\nworker had undergone surgery to correct her hermaphroditic condition prior\nto working for employer. Employer moved for summary judgment. The District\nCourt, O&#8217;Neill, J., held that Pennsylvania Supreme Court would find that\ndiscrimination on basis of gender-corrective surgery did not constitute\ndiscrimination on basis of sex under <span class="caps">PHRA</span>.\n\n

The plain meaning of the term &#8220;sex&#8221;, as it is used in the statute, would\nencompass discrimination against women because of their status as females\nand discrimination against males because of their status as males.\n\n

I am further persuaded that the Supreme Court, if presented with the\nissue, would not include plaintiff within the language of the <span class="caps">PHRA</span>, by\nthe established caselaw under Title <span class="caps">VII</span>.\n
