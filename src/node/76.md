<FONT SIZE="+1">Intersex discrimination permissable under law according<br>to Pennsylvania court</FONT><br><br>

It has been brought to our attention that the United States District<br>Court, E.D. Pennsylvania, is on record with a finding that discrimination<br>on the basis of a history of genital plastic surgery for an intersex condition<br>is permissible under the law. Note that the court did not make any judgment<br>  
about whether or not discrimination actually occurred in this case;<br>rather it found that, even assuming that discrimination alleged by plaintiff<br>had occurred, she is not entitled to relief under the law.<br><br>

Below, some excerpts from 660 F. Supp. 176 (E.D.Pa 1987):<br><br>

Worker brought action claiming employer discriminated against her based<br>on sex in violation of the Pennsylvania Human Rights Act by failing to<br>promote worker and terminating her solely because her employer learned<br>worker had undergone surgery to correct her hermaphroditic condition prior<br>to working for employer. Employer moved for summary judgment. The District<br>Court, O&#8217;Neill, J., held that Pennsylvania Supreme Court would find that<br>discrimination on basis of gender-corrective surgery did not constitute<br>discrimination on basis of sex under <span class="caps">PHRA</span>.<br><br>

The plain meaning of the term &#8220;sex&#8221;, as it is used in the statute, would<br>encompass discrimination against women because of their status as females<br>and discrimination against males because of their status as males.<br><br>

I am further persuaded that the Supreme Court, if presented with the<br>issue, would not include plaintiff within the language of the <span class="caps">PHRA</span>, by<br>the established caselaw under Title <span class="caps">VII</span>.<br>
