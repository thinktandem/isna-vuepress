# Former Hopkins Psychiatry Director Condemns Sex Reassignments

<p>But does the Urology Department listen to the Psychiatry Department?  </p>

<p>&#8220;For children with birth defects the most rational approach at this moment is to correct promptly any of the major urological defects they face, but to postpone any decision about sexual identity until much later, while raising the child according to its genetic sex. Medical caretakers and parents can strive to make the child aware that aspects of sexual identity will emerge as he or she grows. Settling on what to do about it should await maturation and the child&#8217;s appreciation of his or her own identity.&#8221;  </p>
