# San Francisco Human Rights Commission: Intersex Report

The San Francisco Human Rights Commission will have a public meeting on Thursday, January 27, at 4:30 p.m. in San Francisco City Hall, Room 416. The Commissioners are expected to vote on accepting the report detailing the HRC's investigation into the medical treatment of intersex.  
  
This meeting is free and open to the public. It should be quite an exciting moment! ISNA Board members David Cameron and Thea Hillman and other allies have been working on this for a long time!
