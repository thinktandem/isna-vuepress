Participants in the panel include a pediatric psychologist, a pediatric urologist and a patient advocate. The panel discussion will include relevant background information on DSDs that pediatric psychologists should be aware of, medical and psychosocial interventions, and ethical issues. Case examples will be used to highlight how pediatric psychologists can help families and medical staff. Ample time will be allotted to open discussion with audience participants on questions related to clinical care and research.
