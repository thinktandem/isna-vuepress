title: "Calling All Intersex Activists, Supporters,    and Friends:  Help Plan the &quot;Intersex Awareness Day&quot; for 2004 and"
---

 

We are forming a consortium to create an annual day of grass-roots  
action to end shame, secrecy and unwanted genital cosmetic surgeries on intersex  
children, and we want your input! We are hoping to create a "day of  
action" similar to Take Back the Night, National Coming Out Day, or  
International Women's Day in that it will focus on grass-roots action organized  
by local activists. The event will be national&#8212;perhaps even international  
in scope&#8212;but will be marked, celebrated, witnessed, and honored in  
different ways by diverse groups at a local level.

  


The "day" does not belong to any particular group, but it is for  
all of us who are concerned about the treatment of intersex children in our  
society. Through the consortium, we will come up with the name, the date,  
and the mission statement for the event, within which local organizers are  
encouraged to put on creative activities that will raise awareness of intersex  
issues. 

  


This is the perfect opportunity for people concerned about intersex issues  
to get involved! The consortium is open to everyone, and communicates via  
an electronic mailing list. To join the discussion or read previous comments,
