title: Calling All Intersex Activists, Supporters,    and Friends:  Help Plan the &quot;Intersex Awareness Day&quot; for 2004 and
---

We are forming a consortium to create an annual day of grass-roots\n action to end shame, secrecy and unwanted genital cosmetic surgeries on intersex\n children, and we want your input! We are hoping to create a "day of\n action" similar to Take Back the Night, National Coming Out Day, or\n International Women&#8217;s Day in that it will focus on grass-roots action organized\n by local activists. The event will be national&#8212;perhaps even international\n in scope&#8212;but will be marked, celebrated, witnessed, and honored in\n different ways by diverse groups at a local level.\n 

The "day" does not belong to any particular group, but it is for\n all of us who are concerned about the treatment of intersex children in our\n society. Through the consortium, we will come up with the name, the date,\n and the mission statement for the event, within which local organizers are\n encouraged to put on creative activities that will raise awareness of intersex\n issues. \n 

This is the perfect opportunity for people concerned about intersex issues\n to get involved! The consortium is open to everyone, and communicates via\n an electronic mailing list. To join the discussion or read previous comments,\n visit <http://www.intersex-awareness-day.org/modules/news/> \n 

This project is endorsed (but not controlled) jointly by Intersex Society\n of North America, Bodies Like Ours, and Intersex Initiative Portland.
