CONTROVERSY OVER GENITAL SURGERIES HEATS UP AT  
  
ANNUAL PEDIATRICS CONFERENCE  


Noted sex researcher Milton Diamond, in an invited lecture  
  
last Saturday, told the American Academy of Pediatrics that  
  
the time has come to instate&nbsp; a general moratorium on  
  
genital surgeries and sex reassignments performed on  
  
intersex children without their consent.  


"No large scale or even small scale study shows that 'normalizing  
  
surgery' does more good than harm," the University of Hawaii  
  
researcher told the packed room. Though they have been performed  
  
for more than 40 years, the procedures remain experimental,  
  
and without data it is impossible for parents to give informed  
  
consent on their children's behalf, he observed.  


Earlier presentations by surgeons served to underscore Diamond's  
  
charges. Surgeon Laurence Baskin of the University of California  
  
at San Francisco presented three dimensional images of fetal  
  
clitoral neuroanatomy. Though surgeons attempting to reduce  
  
the clitorises of intersex infants have claimed that the  
  
nerves are highly localized in bundles at the 11:00 and 1:00  
  
positions, making possible preservation of sensation and hopefully  
  
sexual function, Baskin's images demonstrated that the  
  
innervation is circumferentially distributed. Questioned  
  
about what this means for the future sexual function of  
  
girls subjected to clitoral surgery as infants,  
  
Baskin repeatedly emphasized, "We have \*no\* data."  


Diamond also called for a concerted effort to be made to undo  
  
the effects of past physician deception. He cited not only the  
  
direct harm inflicted upon patients by deception, but also indirect  
  
effects. A policy of deception undermines relations of trust  
  
and confidence between patient and provider and conveys the clear  
  
message that intersexuality is "unspeakably shameful in the minds  
  
of parents and physicians." And as intersexuality becomes more widely  
  
known,&nbsp; not only intersexuals but the community at large learns  
  
that "doctors choreography familial mendacity and dysfunction."
