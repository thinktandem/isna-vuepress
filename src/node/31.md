Noted sex researcher Milton Diamond, in an invited lecture\n  
last Saturday, told the American Academy of Pediatrics that\n  
the time has come to instate&nbsp; a general moratorium on\n  
genital surgeries and sex reassignments performed on\n  
intersex children without their consent.\n

&#8220;No large scale or even small scale study shows that &#8216;normalizing\n  
surgery&#8217; does more good than harm,&#8221; the University of Hawaii\n  
researcher told the packed room. Though they have been performed\n  
for more than 40 years, the procedures remain experimental,\n  
and without data it is impossible for parents to give informed\n  
consent on their children&#8217;s behalf, he observed.\n

Earlier presentations by surgeons served to underscore Diamond&#8217;s\n  
charges. Surgeon Laurence Baskin of the University of California\n  
at San Francisco presented three dimensional images of fetal\n  
clitoral neuroanatomy. Though surgeons attempting to reduce\n  
the clitorises of intersex infants have claimed that the\n  
nerves are highly localized in bundles at the 11:00 and 1:00\n  
positions, making possible preservation of sensation and hopefully\n  
sexual function, Baskin&#8217;s images demonstrated that the\n  
innervation is circumferentially distributed. Questioned\n  
about what this means for the future sexual function of\n  
girls subjected to clitoral surgery as infants,\n  
Baskin repeatedly emphasized, &#8220;We have **no** data.&#8221;\n

Diamond also called for a concerted effort to be made to undo\n  
the effects of past physician deception. He cited not only the\n  
direct harm inflicted upon patients by deception, but also indirect\n  
effects. A policy of deception undermines relations of trust\n  
and confidence between patient and provider and conveys the clear\n  
message that intersexuality is &#8220;unspeakably shameful in the minds\n  
of parents and physicians.&#8221; And as intersexuality becomes more widely\n  
known,&nbsp; not only intersexuals but the community at large learns\n  
that &#8220;doctors choreography familial mendacity and dysfunction.&#8221;\n
