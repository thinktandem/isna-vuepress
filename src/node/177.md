# Australian Intersex patient-advocate group to collaborate on outcomes research

  
The <a href="http://www.geocities.com/aissg/" target="news">AIS Support Group (Australia)</a> has announced a collaborative effort with Garry Warne of the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne to identify best practice for medical management of children with intersex conditions. The project includes follow-up of 200 former patients. The group notes Professor Warne's "keenness to listen to the personal experiences of members and learn from them" was a key factor in its decision to participate in the effort.
