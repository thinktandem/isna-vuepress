\nThe <a href="http://www.geocities.com/aissg/" target="news"><span class="caps">AIS</span> Support Group (Australia)</a> has announced a collaborative effort with Garry Warne of the Royal Children&#8217;s Hospital Melbourne to identify best practice for medical management of children with intersex conditions. The project includes follow-up of 200 former patients. The group notes Professor Warne&#8217;s &#8220;keenness to listen to the personal experiences of members and learn from them&#8221; was a key factor in its decision to participate in the effort.
