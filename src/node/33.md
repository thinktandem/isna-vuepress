\n> through invasive and medically unnecessary cosmetic surgeries  
\n> on their genitals. That is more than 20 children a year in  
\n> Oregon alone. This lunch hour presentation will combine a  
\n> short (10 min.) film, lecture and discussion to explore the  
\n> role homophobia, biphobia and transphobia played in  
\n> rationalizing such a medical atrocity, and what <span class="caps">LGBT</span>  
\n> activists can do to help end it. This is a brown bag lunch  
\n> seminar for <span class="caps">LGBT</span> activists, sponsored by Basic Rights Oregon.  
\n

\n> is about and where it is going from here. This event is  
\n> sponsored by Survivor Project and Intersex Society of North
