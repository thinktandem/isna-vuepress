# DSD Symposium 2006

  
description:  
  


ISNA is hosting the First DSD Symposium, a gathering of intersex adults, parents, and allied healthcare professionals. This is your chance to meet and learn from others working to improve the quality of healthcare delivered to families with children born with Disorders of Sex Development, and adults dealing with the many ongoing healthcare concerns that result from DSDs.

  
  


The conference takes place in San Francisco, at the Parc 55 Hotel, Friday October 13 thru Sunday October 15.

  
  


The DSD Symposium is a mini-conference, held within the Gay and Lesbian Medical Associationâ€™s annual conference. Registrants to the GLMA conference are welcome to attend all DSD Symposium presentations. Those who are specifically interested in DSDs may register for the DSD Symposium only, at a reduced rate ($125 thru September 15; $150 afterward).
