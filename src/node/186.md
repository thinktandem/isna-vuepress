title: Resources for People dealing with Gender Identity Issues
---

\nSome people who are intersexed need assistance with transitioning gender roles, and some people who are transitioning gender roles visit <span class="caps">ISNA</span>&#8217;s web site looking for resources. There are many resources for this available on the web; below are some of the important links. <span class="caps">ISNA</span> does not have the resources or expertise to help people with this, and we have no plans to duplicate the services provided by existing transgender support and advocacy groups.\n

\nSome transsexual people and their advocates argue that transsexuality is a form of intersexuality that manifests in the brain, citing preliminary researches suggesting a possible biological &#8220;cause&#8221; of transsexuality, or &#8220;gender identity disorder.&#8221; However, such claim misses the point that the intersex movement is not about whether or not something is biologically rooted, but about how our bodies are treated by medical authority as we grow up and live. Some transsexual people are in fact also intersexed and some intersex people do transition genders, majority are not.\n

\nThe descriptions below are, where possible, taken from the descriptions offered by the groups about themselves. <span class="caps">ISNA</span> has no control over the content of these sites.\n<p class=sm align=center>\n
