\nDuring spring 2002 term starting in April, Emi Koyama, the Program \nAssistant for Intersex Society of North America, will teach the \ncourse &#8220;Intersexuality: An Interdisciplinary Exploration&#8221; at \nPortland State University through its student-run Chiron program. \nThis course is believed to be the first of its kind as a for-credit, \nfull-length course about intersexuality.\n

\nThe course consists of three main parts: First, students will learn \nbiological and medical facts about intersexuality and the current \ntreatment model toward intersex conditions. Second, they will \ndiscuss issues raised by intersex activists in the past decade and \nabout the ongoing debate within medicine regarding reforming \nintersex treatment. Lastly, students will learn to critique medical, \nacademic and popular culture materials produced about intersex. The \ncourse mixes lecture, discussion, film, as well as guest speakers. \nThe registration is limited in size and will begin later this month.\n

\nTo familiarize potential students with the topic and get them \ninterested in learning more about it by taking the course, Koyama \nwill hold an &#8220;unofficial open house&#8221; on <span class="caps">PSU</span> campus in which she will \npresent the syllabus for the course and answer questions about the \ncourse and about intersex issues in general. Co-sponsored by <span class="caps">PSU</span> \nWomen&#8217;s Resource Center, the open house will be held at Smith \nMemorial Center room 294 on February 25 at 4:00 pm. The syllabus is \nalso avaialble via email by request in case someone cannot make the \nopen house but is interested in learning more about the course.\n

\nIntersex Society of North America is a 501&#169;(3) non-profit \norganization dedicated to ending shame, secrecy and unwanted genital \nsurgeries on intersex children. For more information about <span class="caps">ISNA</span>, \nvisit http://www.isna.org on the web.\n\n\n
